<p>I would ask the reader to take the present volume,
not as a new book on Dante, but merely as a revision
of the Primer which was first published in
1900. It has been as far as possible brought up to
date, the chief modifications being naturally in
the sections devoted to the poet’s life and <i>Opere
minori</i>, and in the bibliographical appendix; but
the work remains substantially the same. Were
I now to write a new Dante Primer, after the interval
of nearly a quarter of a century, I should
be disposed to attach considerably less importance
to the allegorical meaning of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>,
and to emphasise, more than I have here
done, the aspect of Dante as the symbol and national
hero of Italy.</p>

<p>N.B.—The “Sexcentenary Dante” (the <i>testo critico</i>
published under the auspices of the <i>Società Dantesca
Italiana</i>) adopts a slightly different numbering of the
chapters, or paragraphs, of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> and the second
treatise of the <i>Convivio</i> from that presented by the
“Oxford Dante” and the “Temple Classics.” I have
kept to the latter (which is indicated in brackets in the
<i>testo critico</i>). Similarly, I have followed the numbering
of the <i>Epistolae</i> in Dr. Toynbee’s edition and the “Oxford
Dante” (also given in brackets in the <i>testo critico</i>).
In the section on the lyrical poetry, <i>Rime</i> refers to the
<i>testo critico</i> as edited by Professor Barbi, <i>O</i>. to the new
Oxford edition revised by Dr. Toynbee. In the closing
passage of the Letter to a Florentine friend, I have followed
the reading retained by Dr. Toynbee. I have frequently
availed myself of Dr. Wicksteed’s translation of
the Letters and <i>Monarchia</i>, of Mr. A. G. F. Howell’s
version of the <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>, and occasionally of
Carlyle’s rendering of the <i>Inferno</i>. Every student of
Dante must inevitably owe much to others; but, in this
new edition of my Primer, I would express my indebtedness
in particular to the writings of Dr. Paget Toynbee,
Dr. Philip H. Wicksteed, the late Ernesto Giacomo
Parodi, and Prof. Michele Barbi.</p>

<h3>1. <i>The End of the Middle Ages</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">From Gregory VII. to Frederick II.</span>—The twelfth
and thirteenth centuries cover the last and more
familiar portion of the Middle Ages. They are
the period of chivalry, of the crusades and of
romance, when the Neo-Latin languages bore fruit
in the prose and poetry of France, the lyrics of
the Provençal troubadours, and the earliest vernacular
literature of Italy; the period which saw
the development of Gothic architecture, the rise
of scholastic philosophy, the institution of the
Franciscan and Dominican orders, the recovery
by western Europe of the works of Aristotle, the
elevation of Catholic theology into a systematic
harmony of reason and revelation under the influence
of the christianised Aristotelianism of
Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas. The
vernacular literature of Italy developed comparatively
late, and (until the time of Aquinas and
Bonaventura) her part in the scholastic movement
was secondary to that of France, but she had led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
the way in the revival of the study of Roman law
and jurisprudence, which centred at Bologna,
where the great Irnerius taught at the beginning
of the twelfth century. It was thus that the first
European university, <i>studium generale</i>, came into
being, and Bologna boasts the proud title <i>alma
mater studiorum</i>.</p>

<p>There are two predominant political factors in
Italy which appear at the end of the twelfth century,
and hold the field up to the time of Dante’s
birth. Out of the war of investitures between
Pope and Emperor, the struggle which we associate
mainly with the name of Hildebrand (Gregory
VII.), emerged the Italian city-states, the
free communes of northern and central Italy,
whose development culminated in the heroic resistance
offered by the first Lombard League to
the mightiest of mediaeval German Caesars, Frederick
I. (Barbarossa), which won the battle of
Legnano (1176) and obtained the peace of Constance
(1183). In the south, the Normans—conquering
Apulia and Calabria, delivering Sicily
from the Saracens—consolidated their rule into a
feudal monarchy, making their capital Palermo
one of the most splendid cities of the mediaeval
world. The third and last of these Norman kings
of Sicily, William II. (<i>Par.</i> xx. 61-66), died in
1189. The son of Barbarossa, Henry VI., claimed
the kingdom in the right of his wife Constance
(<i>Par.</i> iii. 115-120), and established the Suabian
dynasty on the throne. His son, Frederick II.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
continued the cultured traditions of the Norman
kings; but the union in his person of the kingdom
of Sicily with the Empire led to a continuous
struggle with the Italian communes and the
Papacy, which embittered his closing years until
his death in 1250. The reign of Frederick II. is
the period of the Guelf and Ghibelline factions,
and the beginning of the rise of tyrants in the
Italian cities, tyrants of whom the most terrible
example was Ezzelino da Romano (<i>Inf.</i> xii. 110).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Battle of Benevento.</span>—The policy of
Frederick II. was continued by his son Manfred
(crowned King of Sicily in 1258), against whom
Pope Clement IV., claiming the right to dispose
of the kingdom as a fief of the Church, summoned
Charles of Anjou, the brother of St. Louis of
France. Charles entered Italy (<i>Purg.</i> xx. 67),
encountered and defeated Manfred on the plains
of Grandella near Benevento, in February 1266,
and the papal legate refused the rites of Christian
burial to the fallen king (<i>Purg.</i> iii. 124-132). This
battle of Benevento marks an epoch in Italian history.
It ended for the time the struggle between
the Roman Pontiffs and the German Caesars; it
initiated the new strife between the Papacy and
the royal house of France. Henceforth the old
ideal significance of “Guelf” and “Ghibelline,”
as denoting adherents of Church and Empire respectively,
becomes lost in the local conflicts of
each Italian district and city. The imperial power
was at an end in Italy; but the Popes, by calling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
in this new foreign aid, had prepared the way for
the humiliation of Pope Boniface at Anagni and
the corruption of Avignon. The fall of the silver
eagle from Manfred’s helmet before the golden
lilies on Charles’s standard may be taken as symbolical.
The preponderance in Italian politics had
passed back from Germany to France; the influence
of the house of Capet was substituted for the
overthrown authority of the Emperor (<i>Purg.</i> xx.
43, 44). Three weeks after the battle Charles entered
Naples in triumph, King of Apulia and
Sicily; an Angevin dynasty was established upon
the throne of the most potent state of Italy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art and Letters.</span>—This political transformation
was profoundly felt in Italian literature. A
new courtly poetry, that of the so-called “Sicilian
School,” had come into being in the south, partly
based on Provençal models, in the first quarter of
the thirteenth century. Its poets—mainly Sicilians
and Apulians, but with recruits from other
parts of the peninsula—had almost given to Italy
a literary language. “The Sicilian vernacular,”
writes Dante in his <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>,
“seems to have gained for itself a renown beyond
the others; for whatever Italians produce in
poetry is called Sicilian, and we find that many
native poets have sung weightily.” This he
ascribes to the fostering influence of the imperial
rule of the house of Suabia: “Those illustrious
heroes, Frederick Caesar and his well-begotten
son Manfred, showing their nobility and rectitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
of soul, as long as fortune lasted, followed human
things, disdaining the bestial; wherefore the noble
in heart and endowed with graces strove to cleave
to the majesty of such great princes; so that, in
their time, whatever the excellent among Italians
attempted first appeared at the court of these
great sovereigns. And, because the royal throne
was Sicily, it came about that whatever our predecessors
produced in the vernacular is called
Sicilian” (<i>V. E.</i> i. 12). The house of Anjou made
Naples their capital, and treated Sicily as a conquered
province. After Benevento the literary
centre of Italy shifted from Palermo and the royal
court of the south to Bologna and the republican
cities of Tuscany. Guittone d’Arezzo (<i>Purg.</i> xxvi.
124-126) founded a school of Tuscan poets, extending
the field of Italian lyrical poetry to political
and ethical themes as well as love (which had
been the sole subject of the Sicilian School). The
beginnings of Italian literary prose had already
appeared at Bologna, with the first vernacular
models for composition of the rhetoricians, the
masters of the <i>ars dictandi</i>. Here, within the next
eight years, St. Thomas Aquinas published the
first and second parts of the <i>Summa Theologica</i>;
and the poetry of the first great singer of modern
Italy, Guido Guinizelli (<i>Purg.</i> xxvi. 91-114), rose
to spiritual heights undreamed of in the older
schools, in his canzone on Love and true nobility:
<i>Al cor gentil ripara sempre Amore</i>; “To the
gentle heart doth Love ever repair.” And, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
sphere of the plastic arts, these were the years
that saw the last triumphs of Niccolò Pisano, “the
Father of Sculpture to Italy,” and the earliest
masterpieces of Cimabue, the teacher of Giotto
(<i>Purg.</i> xi. 94-96), the shepherd boy who came from
the fields to free Italian painting from Byzantine
fetters, and who “developed an artistic language
which was the true expression of the Italian national
character.”</p>


<h3>2. <i>Dante’s Childhood and Adolescence</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Birth and Family.</span>—Dante Alighieri, in its
Latin form Alagherii, was born at Florence in
1265, probably in the latter part of May, some nine
months before the battle of Benevento. His
father, Alighiero di Bellincione di Alighiero, came
of an ancient and honourable family of that section
of the city named from the Porta San Piero.
Although Guelfs, the Alighieri were probably of
the same stock as the Elisei, decadent nobles of
supposed Roman descent, who took the Ghibelline
side in the days of Frederick II., when the city was
first involved in these factions after the murder of
young Buondelmonte in her “last peace” in 1215
(<i>Par.</i> xvi. 136-147). Among the warriors of the
Cross, in the Heaven of Mars, Dante meets his
great-great-grandfather Cacciaguida. Born probably
in 1091, Cacciaguida married a wife from the
valley of the Po, a member of one or other of the
families afterwards known as the Aldighieri or
Alighieri at Ferrara, Parma, and Bologna, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
knighted by Conrad III., and died in battle against
the infidels in the disastrous second crusade (<i>Par.</i>
xv. 137-148). None of Cacciaguida’s descendants
had attained to any distinction in the Republic.
Brunetto di Bellincione, Dante’s uncle, probably
fought for the Guelfs at Montaperti in 1260, where
he may have been one of those in charge of the
<i>carroccio</i>, the battle-car which accompanied the
army. Besides Cacciaguida and his son Alaghiero,
or Alighiero, the first to bear the name, who is
said by his father to be still in the purgatorial terrace
of the proud (<i>Par.</i> xv. 91-96), the only other
member of the family introduced into the <i>Divina
Commedia</i> is Geri del Bello, a grandson of the
elder Alighiero and cousin of Dante’s father, a
sower of discord and a murderer (<i>Inf.</i> xxix.
13-36), whose violent and well-deserved death had
not yet been avenged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Florentine Republic.</span>—As far as Florence
was concerned, the real strife of Guelfs and
Ghibellines was a struggle for supremacy, first
without and then within the city, of a democracy
of merchants and traders, with a military aristocracy
of partly Teutonic descent, who were
gradually being deprived of their territorial and
feudal sway, which they had held nominally from
the Emperor in the <i>contado</i>, the country districts
of Tuscany included in the continually extending
Florentine commune. Although the party names
were first introduced into Florence in 1215, the
struggle had virtually begun after the death of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the great Countess Matilda in 1115; and had resulted
in a regular and constitutional advance of
the power of the people, interrupted by a few
intervals. It was in one of these intervals that
Dante was born. The popular government (<i>Primo
Popolo</i>), which had been established shortly before
the death of Frederick II. in 1250, and worked
victoriously for ten years, had been overthrown
in 1260 at the disastrous battle of Montaperti,
“the havoc and the great slaughter, which dyed
the Arbia red” (<i>Inf.</i> x. 85, 86). The patriotism
of Farinata degli Uberti saved Florence from
total destruction, but all the leading Guelf families
were driven out, and the government remained in
the power of a despotic Ghibelline aristocracy,
under Manfred’s vicar, Count Guido Novello, supported
by German mercenaries. After the fall of
Manfred, an attempt was made to effect a peace
between the Ghibellines and the people; but a
revolution on St. Martin’s Day, November 11th,
1266, led to the expulsion of Guido Novello and
his forces, and the formation of a provisional
democratic government. In January 1267 the
banished Guelfs—many of whom had fought under
the papal banner at Benevento—returned; on
Easter Day French troops entered Florence, the
Ghibellines fled, the Guelfs made Charles of Anjou
suzerain of the city, and accepted his vicar as
podestà. The government was reorganised, with
a new institution, the <i>Parte Guelfa</i>, to secure the
Guelf predominance in the Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>The defeat of young Conradin, grandson of
Frederick II., at Tagliacozzo in 1268, followed by
his judicial murder (<i>Purg.</i> xx. 68), confirmed the
triumph of the Guelfs and the power of Charles
in Italy. In Florence the future conflict lay between
the new Guelf aristocracy and the burghers
and people, between the <i>Grandi</i> and the <i>Popolani</i>;
the magnates in their palaces and towers, associated
into societies and groups of families, surrounding
themselves with retainers and swordsmen,
but always divided among themselves; and
the people, soon to become “very fierce and hot in
lordship,” as Villani says, artisans and traders
ready to rush out from stalls and workshops to
follow the standards of their Arts or Guilds in
defence of liberty. In the year after the House of
Suabia ended with Conradin upon the scaffold, the
Florentines took partial vengeance for Montaperti
at the battle of Colle di Valdelsa (<i>Purg.</i> xiii. 115-120),
where the Sienese were routed and Provenzano
Salvani (<i>Purg.</i> xi. 109-114) killed. It is said
to have been Provenzano Salvani who, in the great
Ghibelline council at Empoli, had proposed that
Florence should be destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dante’s Boyhood.</span>—It is not clear how Dante
came to be born in Florence, since he gives us to
understand (<i>Inf.</i> x. 46-50) that his family were
fiercely adverse to the Ghibellines and would
naturally have been in exile until the close of 1266.
Probably his father, of whom scarcely anything is
known, took no prominent part in politics and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
been allowed to remain in the city. Besides the
houses in the Piazza San Martino, he possessed
two farms and some land in the country. Dante’s
mother, Bella (perhaps an abbreviation of Gabriella),
is believed to have been Alighiero’s first
wife, and to have died soon after the poet’s birth.
Her family is not known, though it has been suggested
that she may have been the daughter of
Durante di Scolaio degli Abati, a Guelf noble.
Alighiero married again, Lapa di Chiarissimo
Cialuffi, the daughter of a prominent Guelf popolano;
by this second marriage he had a son,
Francesco, and a daughter, Tana (Gaetana), who
married Lapo Riccomanni. Another daughter,
whose name is not known, married Leone Poggi; it
is not quite certain whether her mother was Bella
or Lapa. Dante never mentions his mother nor
his father, whom he also lost in boyhood, in any
of his works (excepting such indirect references
as <i>Inf.</i> viii. 45, and <i>Conv.</i> i. 13); but, in the <i>Vita
Nuova</i>, a “young and gentle lady, who was united
to me by very near kindred,” appears watching by
the poet in his illness. In the loveliest of his early
lyrics she is described as</p>

<p class="p0">This lady was, perhaps, one of these two sisters;
and it is tempting to infer from Dante’s words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
that a tender affection existed between him and
her. It was from Dante’s nephew, Andrea Poggi,
that Boccaccio obtained some of his information
concerning the poet, and it would be pleasant to
think that Andrea’s mother is the heroine of this
canzone (<i>V. N.</i> xxiii.); but there are chronological
difficulties in the identification.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sources.</span>—Our sources for Dante’s biography,
in addition to his own works, are primarily a short
chapter in the Chronicle of his neighbour Giovanni
Villani, the epoch-making work of Boccaccio,
Filippo Villani’s unimportant sketch at the
end of the fourteenth and the brief but reliable
life by Leonardo Bruni at the beginning of the
fifteenth century. In addition we have some
scanty hints given by the early commentators on
the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, and a few documents, including
the <i>consulte</i> or reports of the deliberations
of the various councils of the Florentine Republic.
Boccaccio’s work has come down to us in two
forms: the <i>Vita di Dante</i> (or <i>Trattatello in laude
di Dante</i>) and the so-called <i>Compendio</i> (itself in
two redactions, the <i>Primo</i> and <i>Secondo Compendio</i>);
the researches of Michele Barbi have
finally established that both are authentic, the
<i>Compendio</i> being the author’s own later revision.
The tendency of recent scholarship has in a considerable
measure rehabilitated the once discredited
authority of Boccaccio, and rejected the
excessive scepticism represented in the nineteenth
century by Bartoli and Scartazzini.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span>—Although Leonardo Bruni rebukes
Boccaccio, “our Boccaccio that most sweet and
pleasant man,” for having lingered so long over
Dante’s love affairs, still the story of the poet’s
first love remains the one salient fact of his youth
and early manhood. We may surmise from the
<i>Vita Nuova</i> that at the end of his eighteenth year,
presumably in May 1283, Dante became enamoured
of the glorious lady of his mind, Beatrice,
who had first appeared to him as a child in her
ninth year, nine years before. It is not quite certain
whether Beatrice was her real name or one
beneath which Dante conceals her identity; assuredly
she was “Beatrice,” the giver of blessing,
to him and through him to all lovers of the noblest
and fairest things in literature. Tradition, following
Boccaccio, has identified her with Bice, the
daughter of Folco Portinari, a wealthy Florentine
who founded the hospital of S. Maria Nuova, and
died in 1289 (<i>cf.</i> <i>V. N.</i> xxii.). Folco’s daughter is
shown by her father’s will to have been the wife
of Simone dei Bardi, a rich and noble banker.
This has been confirmed by the discovery that,
while the printed commentary of Dante’s son
Pietro upon the <i>Commedia</i> hardly suggests that
Beatrice was a real woman at all, there exists a
fuller and later recension by Pietro of his own
work which contains a distinct statement that the
lady raised to fame in his father’s poem was in
very fact Bice Portinari. Nevertheless, there are
still found critics who see in Beatrice not a real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
woman, but a mystically exalted ideal of womanhood
or a merely allegorical figure; while Scartazzini
at one time maintained that the woman
Dante loved was an unknown Florentine maiden,
who would have been his wife but for her untimely
death. This can hardly be deduced from the <i>Vita
Nuova</i>; in its noblest passages the woman of
Dante’s worship is scarcely regarded as an object
that can be possessed; death has not robbed him
of an expected beatitude, but all the world of an
earthly miracle. But, although it was in the fullest
correspondence with mediaeval ideals and
fashions that chivalrous love and devotion should
be directed by preference to a married woman, the
love of Dante for Beatrice was something at once
more real and more exalted than the artificial
passion of the troubadours; a true romantic love
that linked heaven to earth, and was a revelation
for the whole course of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Poetry, Friendship, Study.</span>—Already, at the
age of eighteen, Dante was a poet: “I had already
seen for myself the art of saying words in rhyme”
(<i>V. N.</i> iii.). It was on the occasion of what we
take as the real beginning of his love that he wrote
the opening sonnet of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, in which
he demands an explanation of a dream from “all
the faithful of Love.” The new poet was at once
recognised. Among the many answers came a
sonnet from the most famous Italian lyrist then
living, Guido Cavalcanti, henceforth to be the
first of Dante’s friends: “And this was, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
were, the beginning of the friendship between him
and me, when he knew that I was he who had sent
that sonnet to him” (<i>cf.</i> <i>Inf.</i> x. 60). In the same
year, 1283, Dante’s name first occurs in a document
concerning some business transactions as his
late father’s heir.</p>

<p>There are no external events recorded in
Dante’s life between 1283 and 1289. Boccaccio
represents him as devoted to study. He certainly
owed much to the paternal advice of the old
rhetorician and statesman, Brunetto Latini, who
had been secretary of the commune and, until his
death in 1294, was one of the most influential citizens
in the state: “For in my memory is fixed,
and now goes to my heart, the dear, kind, paternal
image of you, when in the world, from time to
time, you taught me how man makes himself
eternal” (<i>Inf.</i> xv. 82). Of his growing maturity
in art, the lyrics of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> bear witness;
the prose narrative shows that he had studied the
Latin poets as well as the new singers of Provence
and Italy, had already dipped into scholastic philosophy,
and was not unacquainted with Aristotle.
At the same time, Leonardo Bruni was obviously
right in describing Dante as not severing himself
from the world, but excelling in every youthful
exercise; and it would seem from the <i>Vita Nuova</i>
that, in spite of his supreme devotion for Beatrice,
there were other Florentine damsels who moved
his heart for a time. Dante speaks of “one who,
according to the degrees of friendship, is my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
friend immediately after the first,” and than
whom there was no one nearer in kinship to Beatrice
(<i>V. N.</i> xxxiii.). Those who identify Dante’s
Beatrice with the daughter of Messer Folco suppose
that this second friend was one of her three
brothers, probably Manetto Portinari, to whom a
sonnet of Guido’s may have been addressed. Casella
the musician, and Lapo Gianni the poet, are
mentioned with affection in the <i>Purgatorio</i> (Canto
ii.), and in one of Dante’s sonnets respectively;
Lippo de’ Bardi, evidently like Casella a musician,
and a certain Meuccio likewise appear as friends
in other of his earliest lyrics. Cino da Pistoia,
like Cavalcanti, seems to have answered Dante’s
dream; their friendship was perhaps at present
mainly confined to exchanging poems. Boccaccio
and Benvenuto da Imola speak of an early visit of
Dante’s to the universities of Bologna and Padua,
and there is some evidence for thinking that he
was at Bologna some time not later than 1287.
He may possibly have served in some cavalry
expedition to check the harrying parties of Aretines
in 1288; for, when the great battle of the
following year was fought, it found Dante “no
novice in arms,” as a fragment of one of his lost
letters puts it, <i>non fanciullo nell’ armi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Popular Government.</span>—Twenty years had now
passed since the victory of Colle di Valdelsa in
1269. Great changes had taken place in the meanwhile.
The estrangement between Charles of
Anjou and the Popes, Gregory X. and Nicholas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
III., the attempts of these latter to weaken the
king’s power by reconciling the Florentine Guelfs
with the Ghibelline exiles, and the dissensions
among the Guelf magnates themselves within the
city, had led, in 1280, to the peace arranged by
Cardinal Latino Frangipani. A government was
set up of fourteen <i>buonuomini</i>, magnates and
popolani, eight Guelfs and six Ghibellines. But
the city remained strenuously Guelf. Nicholas III.
had deprived King Charles of the offices of Senator
of Rome and Vicar Imperial and had allowed
Rudolph of Hapsburg to establish a vicar in Tuscany
(<i>Inf.</i> xix. 99). In 1282 came the Vespers of
Palermo (<i>Par.</i> viii. 75). The Sicilians rose, massacred
Charles’s adherents, and received as their
king Peter of Aragon, the husband of Manfred’s
daughter Constance (<i>Purg.</i> iii. 143). The hitherto
united kingdom of Sicily, which had been the
heritage of the imperial Suabians from the Norman
heroes of the house of Hauteville, was thus
divided between a French and a Spanish line of
kings (<i>Par.</i> xx. 63); the former at Naples as kings
of “Sicily and Jerusalem,” the latter in the island
as kings of “Trinacria.” Charles was henceforth
too much occupied in war with the Sicilians and
Aragonese to interfere in the internal affairs of
Tuscany. In the June of this year a peaceful
revolution took place in Florence. Instead of the
fourteen <i>buonuomini</i>, the government was put into
the hands of the Priors of the Arts or Guilds,
who, associated with the Captain, were henceforth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
recognised as the chief magistrates of the Republic,
composing the Signoria, during the two months
for which they were elected to hold office. Their
number, originally three, was raised to six; both
<i>grandi</i> and <i>popolani</i> were at first eligible, provided
the former left their order by enrolling themselves
in one of the Guilds. A thorough organisation of
these Guilds, the <i>Arti maggiori</i> (which were mainly
engaged in wholesale commerce, exportation
and importation, and the mercantile relations of
Florence with foreign countries) and <i>Arti minori</i>
(which carried on the retail traffic and internal
trade of the city), secured the administration in
the hands of the trading classes.</p>

<p>Thus was established the democratic constitution
of the state in which Dante was afterwards
to play his part. There was the central administration
of the six Priors, one for each <i>sesto</i> of the
city, with the council of a hundred “good men of
the people without whose deliberation no great
thing or expenditure could be done” (Villani, vii.
16). The executive was composed of the Captain
of the People and the Podestà, both Italian nobles
from other states, holding office for six months,
each with his two councils, a special and a general
council, the general council of the Podestà being
the general council of the Commune. The great
Guilds had their own council (<i>Consiglio delle
Capitudini delle Arti</i>), and their consuls or rectors,
while specially associated with the two councils
of the Captain, were sometimes admitted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
those of the Podestà; the nobles were excluded
from all these councils, excepting the special council
of the Podestà and the general council of the
Commune. But, while the central government of
the Republic was thus entirely popular, the magnates
still retained control over the captains of
the Guelf Society, with their two councils, and
exerted considerable influence upon the Podestà,
always one of their own order and an alien, in
whose councils they still sat. The Podestà, however,
was now little more than a chief justice; “the
Priors, with the Captain of the People, had to
determine the great and weighty matters of the
commonwealth, and to summon and conduct councils
and make regulations” (Villani).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Battle of Campaldino.</span>—A period of prosperity
and victory followed for Florence. The crushing
defeat inflicted upon Pisa by Genoa at the
great naval battle of Meloria in 1284 was much to
her advantage; as was also, perhaps, the decline
of the Angevin power after the victory of Peter
of Aragon’s fleet (<i>Purg.</i> xx. 79). Charles II., the
“cripple of Jerusalem,” who succeeded his father
as king of Naples, was a less formidable suzerain.
On June 11th, 1289, the Tuscan Ghibellines were
utterly defeated by the Florentines and their allies
at the battle of Campaldino. According to Leonardo
Bruni—and there seems no adequate reason
for rejecting his testimony—Dante was present,
“fighting valiantly on horseback in the front
rank,” apparently among the 150 who volunteered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
or were chosen as <i>feditori</i>, amongst whom was
Vieri de’ Cerchi, who was later to acquire a more
dubious reputation in politics. Bruni states that
in a letter Dante draws a plan of the fight; and he
quotes what seems to be a fragment of another
letter, written later, where Dante speaks of “the
battle of Campaldino, in which the Ghibelline
party was almost utterly destroyed and undone;
where I found myself no novice in arms, and where
I had much fear, and in the end very great gladness,
by reason of the varying chances of that
battle.”</p>

<p>Dante probably took part in the subsequent
events of the campaign; the wasting of the Aretine
territory, the unsuccessful attack upon
Arezzo, the surrender of the Pisan fortress of
Caprona. “Thus once I saw the footmen, who
marched out under treaty from Caprona, fear at
seeing themselves among so many enemies” (<i>Inf.</i>
xxi. 94-96). There appears to be a direct reference
to his personal experiences of the campaign
in the opening of <i>Inferno</i> xxii.: “I have seen ere
now horsemen moving camp and beginning the
assault, and holding their muster, and at times
retiring to escape; coursers have I seen upon your
land, O Aretines! and seen the march of foragers,
the shock of tournaments and race of jousts, now
with trumpets and now with bells, with drums and
castle signals.” He has sung of Campaldino in
peculiarly pathetic strains in Canto V. of the <i>Purgatorio</i>.
On the lower slopes of the Mountain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
Purgation wanders the soul of Buonconte da
Montefeltro, who led the Aretine cavalry, and
whose body was never found; mortally wounded
and forsaken by all, he had died gasping out the
name of Mary, and his Giovanna had forgotten
even to pray for his soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Death of Beatrice.</span>—In the following year,
1290, Beatrice died: “The Lord of justice called
this most gentle one to glory under the banner of
that blessed queen Mary virgin, whose name was
in very great reverence in the words of this
blessed Beatrice” (<i>V. N.</i> xxix.). Although Dante
complicates the date by a reference to “the usage
of Arabia,” she appears to have died on the evening
of June 8th;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the poet lifts up his voice
with the prophet: “How doth the city sit solitary
that was full of people! How is she become as a
widow, she that was great among the nations!”</p>


<h3>3. <i>After the Death of Beatrice</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Philosophic Refuge.</span>—It is not easy to get a
very definite idea of Dante’s private life during
the next ten years. With the completion of the
<i>Vita Nuova</i>, shortly after Beatrice’s death, an
epoch closes in his life, as in his work. From the
<i>Convivio</i> it would appear that in his sorrow Dante
took refuge in the study of the <i>De Consolatione
Philosophiae</i> of Boëthius and Cicero’s <i>De Amicitia</i>;
that he frequented “the schools of the religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
and the disputations of philosophers,” where
he became deeply enamoured of Philosophy. Cino
da Pistoia addressed to him an exceedingly beautiful
canzone, consoling him for the loss of Beatrice,
bidding him take comfort in the contemplation of
her glory among the saints and angels of Paradise,
where she is praying to God for her lover’s peace.
This poem is quoted years later by Dante himself
in the second book of the <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>
(ii. 6), where he couples it with his own canzone—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Love that in my mind discourses to me,” with
which Casella consoles the penitent spirits upon
the shore of Purgatory: “The amorous chant
which was wont to quiet all my desires.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aberrations.</span>—It would seem, however, that
neither the memory of Beatrice nor his philosophical
devotion kept Dante from falling into what
he afterwards came to regard as a morally unworthy
life. <i>Tanto giù cadde</i>, “so low he fell”
(<i>Purg.</i> xxx. 136). It is almost impossible to hold,
as Witte and Scartazzini would have us do, that
the poignant reproaches which Beatrice addresses
to Dante, when he meets her on Lethe’s banks, are
connected mainly with intellectual errors, with
culpable neglect of Theology or speculative wanderings
from revealed truth, for there are but
scanty, if any, traces of this in the poet’s writings
at any period of his career. The dark wood in
which he wandered, led by the world and the flesh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
was that of sensual passion and moral aberration
for a while from the light of reason and the virtue
which is the “ordering of love.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friendship with Forese Donati.</span>—Dante was
evidently intimate with the great Donati family,
whose houses were in the same district of the city.
Corso di Simone Donati, a turbulent and ambitious
spirit, had done heroically at Campaldino, and
was now intent upon having his own way in the
state. A close and familiar friendship united
Dante with Corso’s brother Forese, a sensual man
of pleasure. Six sonnets interchanged between
these two friends, though now only in part intelligible,
do little credit to either. “If thou recall
to mind,” Dante says to Forese in the sixth terrace
of Purgatory, “what thou wast with me and
I was with thee, the present memory will still be
grievous” (<i>Purg.</i> xxiii, 115). Forese died in July
1296; the author of the <i>Ottimo Commento</i>, who
wrote about 1334, and professes to have known
the divine poet, tells us that Dante induced his
friend when on his death-bed to repent and receive
the last sacraments. Another sonnet of Dante’s
shows him in friendly correspondence with Brunetto
(Betto) Brunelleschi, a noble who later
played a sinister part in the factions and, like
Corso Donati, met a violent death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loves, Marriage, and Debts.</span>—Several very
striking canzoni, written for a lady whom Dante
represents under various stony images, and whose
name may possibly have been Pietra, are frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
assigned to this period of the poet’s life,
but may perhaps have been written in the early
days of his exile. From other lyrics and sonnets
we dimly discern that several women may have
crossed Dante’s life now and later, of whom
nothing can be known. Dante married Gemma di
Manetto Donati, a distant kinswoman of Corso and
Forese. In the <i>Paradiso</i> (xvi. 119) he refers with
complacency to his wife’s ancestor, Ubertino
Donati, Manetto’s great-grandfather, whose family
pride scorned any alliance with the Adimari.
According to Boccaccio, the marriage took place
some time after the death of Beatrice, and it was
certainly not later than 1297; but there is documentary
evidence that Gemma’s dowry was settled
in 1277, which points to an early betrothal. The
union has generally been supposed—on somewhat
inadequate grounds—to have been an unhappy
one. Gemma bore Dante two sons, Jacopo and
Pietro, and either one or two daughters. Boccaccio’s
statement, that she did not share the poet’s
exile, is usually accepted; she was living in Florence
after his death, and died there after 1332.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
During the following years, between 1297 and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
1300, Dante was contracting debts (Durante di
Scolaio degli Abati and Manetto Donati being
among his sureties), which altogether amounted to
a very large sum, but which were cleared off from
the poet’s estate after his death.</p>


<h3>4. <i>Dante’s Political Life</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Election of Boniface VIII.</span>—Upon the abdication
of Celestine V., Cardinal Benedetto Gaetani
was made Pope on Christmas Eve 1294, under the
title of Boniface VIII. (<i>Inf.</i> xix. 52-57), an event
ominous for Florence and for Dante. Although
canonised by the Church, there is little doubt that
St. Celestine is the first soul met by Dante in the
vestibule of Hell: <i>Colui che fece per viltà il gran
rifiuto</i> (<i>Inf.</i> iii. 58-60), “He who made from
cowardice the great renunciation.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giano della Bella.</span>—Florence had just confirmed
the democratic character of her constitution
by the reforms of Giano della Bella, a noble
who had identified himself with the popular cause
(<i>Par.</i> xvi. 132). By the Ordinances of Justice in
1293 stringent provisions were enacted against
the nobles, who since Campaldino had grown increasingly
aggressive towards the people and factious
against each other. They were henceforth
more rigorously excluded from the Priorate and
Council of the Hundred, as also from the councils
of the Captain and Capitudini; severe penalties
were exacted for offences against <i>popolani</i>;
and, in order that these ordinances should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
carried out, a new magistrate, the Gonfaloniere
di Guistizia or Standard-bearer of Justice, was
added to the Signoria to hold office like the Priors
for two months in rotation from the different districts
of the city. Thus was completed the <i>secondo
popolo</i>, the second democratic constitution of
Florence. The third of these standard-bearers
was Dino Compagni, the chronicler. Giano della
Bella was meditating the continuation of his work
by depriving the captains of the Guelf Society of
their power and resources, when a riot, in which
Corso Donati played a prominent part, caused his
overthrow in March 1295. By his fall the government
remained in the hands of the rich burghers,
being practically an oligarchy of merchants and
bankers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Steps in Political Life.</span>—In this same
year 1295, the first year of the pontificate of Boniface
VIII., Dante entered political life. Although
of noble descent, the Alighieri do not seem to have
ranked as magnates. By a modification in the
Ordinances of Justice in July 1295, citizens, without
actually exercising an “art,” were admitted
to office provided they had matriculated and were
not knights, if not more than two persons in their
family had held knighthood within the last twenty
years. Dante now (or perhaps a little later)
enrolled his name in the <i>matricola</i> of the Art
of Physicians and Apothecaries, which included
painters and booksellers. For the six months
from November 1st, 1295, to April 30th, 1296,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
he was a member of the Special Council of the
Captain. On December 14th, as one of the savi
or specially summoned counsellors, he gave his
opinion (<i>consuluit</i>) in the Council of the Capitudini
of the Arts on the procedure to be adopted
for the election of the new Signoria. On January
23rd, 1296, the Pope inaugurated his aggressive
policy towards the Republic by addressing a bull
to the Podestà, Captain, Ancients, Priors and Rectors
of the Arts, to the Council and the Commune
of Florence (purposely ignoring the new office of
Gonfaloniere). After denouncing in unmeasured
terms the wickedness of that “rock of scandal,”
Giano della Bella, and extolling the prudence of
the Florentines in expelling him, the Pope, hearing
that certain persons are striving to obtain his
recall, utterly forbids anything of the kind without
special licence from the Holy See, under penalty
of excommunication and interdict. The Pope
further protests his great and special affection for
Florence, amongst the cities devoted to God and
the Apostolic See. “I love France so well,” says
Shakespeare’s King Henry, “that I will not part
with a village of it; I will have it all mine.”</p>

<p>Although Boccaccio, and others in his steps,
have somewhat exaggerated Dante’s influence in
the politics of the Republic, there can be no doubt
that he soon came to take a decided attitude in
direct opposition to all lawlessness, and in resistance
to any external interference in Florentine
matters, whether from Rome, Naples, or France.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
The eldest son of Charles II., Carlo Martello,
whom Dante had “loved much and with good
cause” (<i>Par.</i> viii. 55) during his visit to Florence
in the spring of 1294, had died in the following
year; and his father was harassing the Florentines
for money to carry on the Sicilian war. Dante,
on leaving the Council of the Captain, had been
elected to the Council of the Hundred, in which,
on June 5th, 1296, he spoke in support of various
proposals, including one on the embellishment of
the cathedral and baptistery by the removal of the
old hospital, and another undertaking not to receive
men under ban of the Commune of Pistoia
in the city and contado of Florence. In the previous
May, in consequence of internal factions, Pistoia
had given Florence control of the city, with
power to send a podestà and a captain every six
months. After this we do not hear of Dante again
until May 7th, 1300, when he acted as ambassador
to San Gemignano to announce that a parliament
was to be held for the purpose of electing a captain
for the Guelf League of Tuscany, and to invite
the Commune to send representatives. But already
the storm cloud which loomed on the horizon
had burst upon the city on May Day 1300.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blacks and Whites.</span>—The new division of
parties in Florence became associated with the
feud between two noble families, the Donati and
the Cerchi, headed respectively by two of the
heroes of Campaldino, Corso Donati and Vieri
de’ Cerchi. The names Neri and Bianchi, Black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
Guelfs and White Guelfs, by which the two factions
became known, seem to have been derived
from a similar division in Pistoia, the ringleaders
of which, being banished to Florence, embittered
the quarrels already in progress in the ruling city.
But the roots of the trouble went deeper and were
political, connected with the discontent of both
magnates and <i>popolo minuto</i> under the hegemony
of the Greater Arts. The Bianchi were opposed
to a costly policy of expansion; the Neri, who had
wider international and mercantile connections,
looked beyond the affairs of the Commune, and
favoured intimate relations with the Angevin sovereigns
of Naples and the Pope. To the Bianchi
adhered those nobles who had matriculated in
the Arts, the more moderate spirits among the
burghers, the remains of the party of Giano
della Bella who supported the Ordinances of Justice
in a modified form. While the Bianchi drew
closer to the constitutional government, the
strength of the Neri lay in the councils of the
Guelf Society and the influence of the aristocratic
bankers. Guido Cavalcanti (who, even after the
modification of the Ordinances, would have been
excluded from office) was allied with the Cerchi,
but probably less influenced by political considerations
than by his personal hostility towards Messer
Corso, who was in high favour with the Pope.
Florence was now indeed “disposed for woeful
ruin” (<i>Purg.</i> xxiv. 81), but there had been a “long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
contention” (<i>Inf.</i> vi. 64) before the parties came
to bloodshed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Jubilee.</span>—On February 22nd, 1300, Pope
Boniface issued the bull proclaiming the first
papal jubilee. It began with the previous Christmas
Day and lasted through the year 1300.
Amongst the throngs of pilgrims from all parts
of the world to Rome were Giovanni Villani and,
probably, Dante (<i>Inf.</i> xviii. 29). This visit to
Rome inspired Villani to undertake his great
chronicle; and it is the epoch to which Dante
assigns the vision which is the subject of the
<i>Divina Commedia</i> (<i>Purg.</i> ii. 98). The Pope, however,
had his eyes on Florence, and had apparently
resolved to make Tuscany a part of the Papal
States. Possibly he had already opened negotiations
with the Neri through his agents and bankers,
the Spini. A plot against the state on the
part of three Florentines in the service of the
Pope was discovered to the Signoria, and sentence
passed against the offenders on April 18th.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Boniface
wrote to the Bishop of Florence, on April
24th, 1300, demanding from the Commune that
the sentences should be annulled and the accusers
sent to him. The Priors having refused compliance
and denied his jurisdiction in the matter,
the Pope issued a second bull, declaring that he
had no intention of derogating from the jurisdiction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
or liberty of Florence, which he intended to
increase; but asserting the absolute supremacy of
the Roman Pontiff both in spiritual and temporal
things over all peoples and kingdoms, and demanding
again, with threats of vengeance spiritual and
temporal, that the sentences against his adherents
should be annulled, that the three accusers with
six of the most violent against his authority should
appear before him, and that the officers of the
Republic should send representatives to answer
for their conduct. This was on May 15th, but, two
days earlier, the Pope had written to the Duke of
Saxony, and sent the Bishop of Ancona to Germany,
to demand from Albert of Austria the renunciation
absolutely to the Holy See of all rights
claimed by the Emperors in Tuscany.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dante’s Priorate.</span>—But in the meantime bloodshed
had taken place in Florence. On May 1st the
two factions came to blows in the Piazza di Santa
Trinita; and on May 4th full powers had been
given to the Priors to defend the liberty of the
Commune and People of Florence against dangers
from within and without (which had evidently
irritated the Pope). The whole city was now
divided; magnates and burghers alike became bitter
partisans of one or other faction. The Pope,
who had previously made a vain attempt to reconcile
Vieri de’ Cerchi with the Donati, sent the
Franciscan Cardinal Matteo d’Acquasparta as
legate and peacemaker to Florence, in the interests
of the captains of the Guelf Society and the Neri,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
who accused the Signoria of Ghibelline tendencies.
The Cardinal arrived in June. From June 15th
to August 14th Dante was one of the six Priors by
election. “All my misfortunes,” he says in the
letter quoted by Leonardo Bruni, “had their cause
and origin in my ill-omened election to the Priorate;
of which Priorate, though by prudence I was
not worthy, still by faith and age I was not unworthy.”
We know too little of the facts to be
able to comment upon this cryptic utterance. On
the first day of office (June 15th), the sentence
passed in the previous April against the three
Florentines in the papal service was formally consigned
to Dante and his colleagues—Lapo Gianni
(probably the same person as his poet friend of
that name) acting as notary. There were disturbances
in the city. On St. John’s Eve an
assault was made upon the Consuls of the Arts
by certain magnates of the Neri, and their opponents
threatened to take up arms. The Priors,
perhaps on Dante’s motion, exiled (or, more accurately,
put under bounds outside the territory
of the Republic) some prominent members of both
factions, including Corso Donati and Guido Cavalcanti.
The Neri attempted to resist, expecting
aid from the Cardinal and from Lucca; the Bianchi
obeyed. Negotiations continued between the
Signoria and the Cardinal, Dante and his colleagues
resisting the papal demands without coming
to a formal rupture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bianchi in Power.</span>—The succeeding Signoria<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
was less prudent. The banished Bianchi
were allowed to return just after Dante had left
office (as he himself states in a lost letter seen by
Leonardo Bruni), on the plea of the illness of
Guido Cavalcanti, who had contracted malaria at
Sarzana, and died at Florence in the last days
of August. At the end of September a complete
rupture ensued with Cardinal Matteo d’Acquasparta,
who broke off negotiations and retired to
Bologna, leaving the city under an interdict.
Corso Donati had broken bounds and gone to the
Pope, who, towards the close of 1300, nominated
Charles of Valois, brother of Philip the Fair,
captain-general of the papal states, and summoned
him to Italy to aid Charles of Naples against
Frederick of Aragon in Sicily and reduce the
“rebels” of Tuscany to submission.</p>

<p>We meet the name of Dante on several occasions
among the <i>consulte</i> of the Florentine Republic
during 1301. It is probable that he was one of
the <i>savi</i> called to council on March 15th, and that
he opposed the granting of a subsidy in money
which the King of Naples had demanded for the
Sicilian war and which was made by the Council
of the Hundred.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> On April 14th he was among
the <i>savi</i> in the Council of the Capitudini for the
election of the new Signoria, of which Palmieri
Altoviti was the leading spirit. On April 28th
Dante was appointed <i>officialis et superestans</i>, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
connection with the works in the street of San
Procolo, possibly with the object of more readily
bringing up troops from the country. During the
priorate of Palmieri Altoviti (April 15th to June
14th), a conspiracy was discovered, hatched at a
meeting of the Neri in the church of S. Trinita, to
overthrow the government and invite the Pope to
send Charles of Valois to Florence. In consequence
a number of Neri were banished and their
possessions confiscated, a fresh sentence being
passed against Corso Donati. The Bianchi were
all potent in Florence; and, in May 1301, they
procured the expulsion of the Neri from Pistoia
(ruthlessly carried out by the Florentine captain,
Andrea Gherardini), which was the beginning of
the end (<i>Inf.</i> xxiv. 143): “Pistoia first is thinned
of Neri; then Florence renovates folk and rule.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Coming of Charles of Valois.</span>—The government
still shrank from directly opposing the
Pope, who, by letter from Cardinal Matteo d’Acquasparta,
demanded the continuation of the
service of a hundred horsemen. On June 19th,
1301, in a united meeting of the Councils of the
Hundred, of the Captain, and of the Capitudini,
and again in the Council of the Hundred apart,
Dante spoke against compliance, urging “quod de
servitio faciendo domini Papae nihil fiat”—with
the result that the matter was postponed. In the
united Councils of the Hundred, the Captain, the
Podestà, and the Capitudini, on September 13th,
he pleaded for the preservation of the Ordinances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
of Justice (a sign that the State was regarded as
in peril). On this occasion all the twenty-one arts
were represented, which we may connect with
Leonardo Bruni’s statement that Dante had advised
the Priors to strengthen themselves with
the support of the “moltitudine del popolo.” On
September 20th, in the Council of the Captain,
he supported a request of the ambassadors of the
Commune of Bologna (then allied with the Bianchi)
for free passage for their importation of
grain. On September 28th, again in the Council
of the Captain, he defended a certain Neri di
Gherardino Diedati (whose father was destined
to share the poet’s fate) from an injust charge.
This is the last recorded time that <i>Dantes Alagherii
consuluit</i> in Florence. Already Charles of
Valois was on his way, preparing to “joust with
the lance of Judas” (<i>Purg.</i> xx. 70-78). On November
1st, after giving solemn pledges to the
Signoria (Dino Compagni being one of the
Priors), Charles with 1200 horsemen entered
Florence without opposition.</p>

<p>Leonardo Bruni asserts that Dante was absent
at Rome on an embassy to the Pope when the
latter’s “peacemaker” entered Florence. It
would appear that the Florentine government had
requested the allied Commune of Bologna to send
an embassy to Boniface, simultaneously with an
embassy from Siena with which were associated
three ambassadors from Florence: Maso di Ruggierino
Minerbetti, Corazza da Signa, and Dante<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
Alighieri. Their purpose was to make their own
terms with the Pontiff in order to avert the intervention
of Charles. The mission set out at the
beginning of October; but one of the Bolognese
ambassadors, Ubaldino Malavolti, having business
of his own with the Florentine government, delayed
the others so long that they did not arrive
in time.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Boccaccio asserts that, when the Bianchi
proposed to send Dante on such an embassy, he
answered somewhat arrogantly: “If I go, who
stays? and if I stay, who goes?” According to
Dino Compagni, Boniface sent two of the Florentines—Maso
Minerbetti and Corazza da Signa—back
to Florence to demand submission to his will,
but detained Dante at his court. The fact of Dante
taking part in such an embassy is confirmed by the
author of the <i>Ottimo Commento</i>, as also by an
anonymous commentator on the canzone of the
<i>Tre donne</i>, and, though seriously questioned by
many Dante scholars, it is now generally accepted
as historical. The other two ambassadors returned
almost simultaneously with the arrival of
the French prince. Yielding to necessity and
trusting to his solemn oath, the Signoria, in a
parliament held in S. Maria Novella, gave Charles
authority to pacify the city; which he set about
doing by restoring the Neri to power. Corso<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Donati with his allies entered Florence in arms,
to plunder and massacre at their pleasure, the last
Signoria of the Bianchi being compelled to resign
on November 7th (cf. <i>Purg.</i> vi. 143, 144). A
second effort by the Cardinal Matteo from the
Pope to reconcile the two factions was resisted by
Charles and the Neri; and the work of proscription
began. The new Podestà, Cante de’ Gabrielli
da Gubbio, passed sentence after sentence against
the ruined Bianchi. Finally, at the beginning of
April, their chiefs were betrayed into a real or
pretended conspiracy against Charles, and driven
out with their followers and adherents, both nobles
and burghers, six hundred in number; their houses
were destroyed, and their goods confiscated, themselves
sentenced as rebels. On April 4th, 1302,
Charles left Florence, covered with disgrace and
full of plunder, leaving the government entirely in
the hands of the Neri. “Having cast forth the
greatest part of the flowers from thy bosom, O
Florence,” writes Dante in the <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>,
“the second Totila went fruitlessly to
Sicily” (<i>V. E.</i> ii. 6).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sentences against Dante.</span>—The first sentence
against Dante is dated January 27th, 1302, and
includes four other names. Gherardino Diedati,
formerly Prior, is accused of taking bribes for the
release of a prisoner, and has not appeared when
summoned. Palmieri Altoviti (who had taken the
lead in putting down the conspiracy hatched in
Santa Trinita), Dante Alighieri, Lippo Becchi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
(one of the denouncers of Boniface’s agents in
1300), and Orlanduccio Orlandi are accused of
“barratry,” fraud and corrupt practices, unlawful
gains and extortions and the like, in office and
out of office; of having corruptly and fraudulently
used the money and resources of the Commune
against the Supreme Pontiff, and to resist the
coming of Messer Carlo, or against the pacific
state of Florence and the Guelf Party; of having
caused the expulsion of the Neri from Pistoia, and
severed that city from Florence and the Church.
Since they have contumaciously absented themselves,
when summoned to appear before the Podestà’s
court, they are held to have confessed their
guilt, and sentenced to pay a heavy fine and restore
what they have extorted. If not paid in
three days, all their goods shall be confiscated;
even if they pay, they are exiled for two years and
perpetually excluded as falsifiers and barrators,
<i>tamquam falsarii et barattarii</i>, from holding any
office or benefice under the Commune of Florence.
On March 10th, a further sentence condemns these
five with ten others to be burned to death, if any
of them at any time shall come into the power of
the Commune. In this latter sentence there is no
mention of any political offence, but only of malversation
and contumacy. None of Dante’s six
colleagues in the Signoria are included in either
sentence; but in the second appear the names of
Lapo Salterelli, who had headed the opposition to
Boniface in the spring of 1300, but whom the poet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
judges sternly (cf. <i>Par.</i> xv. 128), and Andrea
Gherardini, who had been Florentine captain at
Pistoia.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that, in spite of the
wording of these two sentences, Dante’s real
offence was his opposition to the policy of Pope
Boniface. In the <i>De Volgari Eloquentia</i> (i. 6) he
declares that he is suffering exile unjustly because
of his love for Florence. All his early biographers
bear testimony to his absolute innocence of the
charge of malversation and barratry; it has been
left to modern commentators to question it. In
the letter to a Florentine friend, Dante speaks of
his innocence manifest to all, <i>innocentia manifesta
quibuslibet</i>, as though in direct answer to the <i>fama
publica referente</i> of the Podestà’s sentence. His
likening himself to Hippolytus is a no less emphatic
protestation of innocence: “As Hippolytus
departed from Athens, by reason of his pitiless
and treacherous stepmother, so from Florence
needs must thou depart. This is willed, this is
already being sought, and soon will it be done for
him who thinks it, there where Christ is put to
sale each day” (<i>Par.</i> xvii. 46-51). “I hold my
exile as an honour”:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">he says in his canzone of the <i>Tre donne</i>. Had
Dante completed the <i>Convivio</i>, he would probably
have furnished us with a complete apologia in the
fourteenth treatise, where he intended to comment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
upon this canzone and discuss Justice. “Justice,”
he says in <i>Conv.</i> i. 12, “is so lovable that, as the
philosopher says in the fifth of the Ethics, even
her enemies love her, such as thieves and robbers;
and therefore we see that her contrary, which is
injustice, is especially hated (as is treachery, ingratitude,
falseness, theft, rapine, deceit, and
their like). The which are such inhuman sins
that, to defend himself from the infamy of these,
it is conceded by long usance that a man may
speak of himself, and may declare himself to be
faithful and loyal. Of this virtue I shall speak
more fully in the fourteenth treatise.”</p>


<h3>5. <i>First Period of Exile</i></h3>

<p>“Since it was the pleasure of the citizens of the
most beautiful and most famous daughter of
Rome, Florence, to cast me forth from her sweet
bosom (in which I was born and nourished up to
the summit of my life, and in which, with her
goodwill, I desire with all my heart to rest my
wearied mind and to end the time given me), I
have gone through almost all the parts to which
this language extends, a pilgrim, almost a beggar,
showing against my will the wound of fortune,
which is wont unjustly to be ofttimes reputed to
the wounded.”</p>

<p>In these words (<i>Conv.</i> i. 3), Dante sums up the
earlier portion of his exile. There are few lines
of poetry more noble in pathos, more dignified in
reticence, than those which he has put into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
mouth of Cacciaguida (<i>Par.</i> xvii. 55-60): “Thou
shalt leave everything beloved most dearly, and
this is that arrow which the bow of exile first
shoots. Thou shalt test how savours of salt another’s
bread, and how hard the ascending and
descending by another’s stairs.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Early Days of Exile.</span>—The terms of the first
sentence against Dante seem to imply that, if he
had returned to Florence, he fled from the city
before January 27th, 1302. We do not know
where he went. Boccaccio, apparently from a
misunderstanding of <i>Par.</i> xvii. 70, says Verona;
if we suppose it to have been Siena, this would
explain Leonardo Bruni’s account of Dante’s first
hearing particulars of his ruin at the latter city.
The sentence against Messer Vieri de’ Cerchi,
with the other leaders, is dated April 5th in the
terrible <i>Libro del Chiodo</i>, the black book of the
Guelf Party. Arezzo, Forlì, Siena, Bologna, were
the chief resorts of the exiled Bianchi; in Bologna
they seem for some time to have been especially
welcome. Dante first joined them in a meeting
held at Gargonza, where they are said by Bruni
to have made the poet one of their twelve councillors,
and to have fixed their headquarters at
Arezzo. For a short time Dante made common
cause with them, but found their society extremely
uncongenial (<i>Par.</i> xvii. 61-66). On June 8th, 1302,
there is documentary evidence of his presence with
some others in the choir of San Godenzo at the
foot of the Apennines, where the Bianchi allied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
with the Ghibelline Ubaldini to make war upon
Florence. The fact of this meeting having been
held in Florentine territory and followed by several
cavalry raids induced a fresh sentence in July
from the new Podestà, Gherardino da Gambara
of Brescia, in which, however, Dante is not mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Failure of the Bianchi.</span>—A heavy blow was
inflicted upon the exiles by the treachery of Carlino
di Pazzi (<i>Inf.</i> xxxii. 69), who surrendered the
castle of Piantravigne in Valdarno to the Neri,
when many Bianchi were slain or taken. The
cruelty of the Romagnole, Count Fulcieri da Calboli,
the next Podestà of Florence from January
to September 1303, towards such of the unfortunate
Bianchi as fell into his hands has received its
meed of infamy in <i>Purg.</i> xiv. 58-66. It is perhaps
noteworthy (as bearing upon the date of Dante’s
separation from his fellow-exiles) that the poet’s
name does not appear among the Bianchi who,
under the leadership of the Ghibelline captain,
Scarpetta degli Ordelaffi of Forlì, signed an agreement
with their allies in Bologna on June 18th in
this year; but this may merely imply that he did
not go to Bologna. He was possibly associated
with Scarpetta at Forlì about this time. These
renewed attempts to recover the state by force of
arms resulted only in the disastrous defeat of
Pulicciano in Mugello.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Death of Boniface VIII.</span>—In this same year
Sciarra Colonna and William of Nogaret, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
name of Philip the Fair, seized Boniface VIII. at
Anagni, and treated the old Pontiff with such
barbarity that he died in a few days, October 11th,
1303. The seizure had been arranged by the infamous
Musciatto Franzesi, who had been instrumental
in the bringing of Charles of Valois to
Florence. “I see the golden lilies enter Alagna,”
cries Hugh Capet in the <i>Purgatorio</i>; “and in His
vicar Christ made captive. I see Him mocked a
second time. I see renewed the vinegar and gall,
and Him slain between thieves that live” (<i>Purg.</i>
xx. 86-90).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Benedict XI.</span>—In succession to Boniface, Nicholas
of Treviso, the master-general of the Dominicans,
a man of humble birth and of saintly life,
was made Pope on October 22nd, 1303, as Benedict
XI. He at once devoted himself to healing the
wounds of Italy, and sent to Florence as peacemaker
the Dominican Cardinal, Niccolò da Prato,
who was of Ghibelline origin. The peacemaker
arrived in March 1304, and was received with
great honour. Representatives of the Bianchi and
Ghibellines came to the city at his invitation; and,
when May opened, there was an attempt to revive
the traditional festivities which had ended on that
fatal May Day of 1300. But a terrible disaster
on the Ponte alla Carraia cast an ominous gloom
over the city, and the Neri treacherously forced
the Cardinal to leave. Hardly had he gone when,
on June 10th, fighting broke out in the streets, and
a fire, purposely started by the Neri, devastated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
Florence. On July 7th Pope Benedict died, perhaps
poisoned, at Perugia; and, seeing this last
hope taken from them, the irreconcilable portion
of the Bianchi, led by Baschiera della Tosa, aided
by the Ghibellines of Tuscany under Tolosato
degli Uberti, with allies from Bologna and Arezzo,
made a valiant attempt to surprise Florence
on July 20th from Lastra. Baschiera, with about
a thousand horsemen, captured a part of the
suburbs, and drew up his force near San Marco,
“with white standards displayed, and garlands of
olives, with drawn swords, crying peace” (Compagni).
Through his impetuosity and not awaiting
the coming of Tolosato, this enterprise ended
in utter disaster, and with its failure the last
hopes of the Bianchi were dashed to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Separation from the Bianchi and Wanderings
in Exile.</span>—After the defeat of Lastra, Bruni
represents Dante as going from Arezzo to Verona,
utterly humbled. We learn from the <i>Paradiso</i>
(xvii. 61-69) that, estranged from his fellow-exiles
who had turned violently against him, he had been
compelled to form a party to himself. It is held
by some scholars that he had broken away from
them in the previous year, and that, towards the
end of 1303, he had found his first refuge at
Verona in “the courtesy of the great Lombard,”
Bartolommeo della Scala, at whose court he now
first saw his young brother, afterwards famous as
Can Grande, and already in boyhood showing
sparks of future greatness (<i>ibid.</i> 70-78). Others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
would identify <i>il gran Lombardo</i> with Bartolommeo’s
brother and successor, Albuino della Scala,
who ruled in Verona from March 1304 until October
1311, and associated Can Grande with him
as the commander of his troops. There is no certain
documentary evidence of Dante’s movements
between June 1302 and October 1306. It is not
improbable that, in 1304 or 1305, he stayed some
time at Bologna. The first book of the <i>De Vulgari
Eloquentia</i> seems in many respects to bear witness
to this stay at Bologna, where the exiles were
still welcome; a certain kindliness towards the
Bolognese, very different from his treatment of
them later in the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, is apparent,
together with a peculiar acquaintance with their
dialect. But on March 1st, 1306, the Bolognese
made a pact with the Neri, after which they expelled
the Florentine exiles, ordering that no
Bianchi or Ghibellines should be found in Bolognese
territory on pain of death. Dante perhaps
went to Padua from Bologna, and, though the
supposed documentary proof of his residence in
Padua on August 27th, 1306, cannot be accepted
without reserve, it is tempting to accept the statement
of Benvenuto da Imola that the poet was
entertained by Giotto when the painter was engaged
upon the frescoes of the Madonna dell’
Arena. In October, Dante was in Lunigiana, a
guest of the Malaspina, that honoured race
adorned with the glory of purse and sword (<i>Purg.</i>
viii. 121-139). Here, according to Boccaccio, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
recovered from Florence some manuscript which
he had left behind him in his flight; possibly what
he afterwards rewrote as the first seven cantos
of the <i>Inferno</i>. On October 6th he acted as ambassador
and <i>nuncio</i> of the Marquis Franceschino
Malaspina in establishing peace between his house
and the Bishop of Luni. This is the last certain
trace of Dante’s feet in Italy for nearly five years.
There is a strangely beautiful canzone of his
which may have been written at this time. Love
has seized upon the poet in the midst of the Alps
(<i>i.e.</i> Apennines): “In the valley of the river by
whose side thou hast ever power upon me”;
“Thou goest, my mountain song; perchance shalt
see Florence, my city, that bars me out of herself,
void of love and nude of pity; if thou dost enter
in, go saying: Now my maker can no more make
war upon you; there, whence I come, such a chain
binds him that, even if your cruelty relax, he has
no liberty to return hither.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Dante had probably, as Bruni tells us, been
abstaining from any hostile action towards Florence,
and hoping to be recalled by the government
spontaneously. There are traces of this state of
mind in the <i>Convivio</i> (i. 3). It would be about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
this time that he wrote in vain the letter mentioned
by Bruni, but now lost, <i>Popule mee quid feci tibi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clement V.—Death of Corso Donati.</span>—In the
meantime Clement V., a Gascon, and formerly
Archbishop of Bordeaux, had been elected Pope.
“From westward there shall come a lawless shepherd
of uglier deeds” than even Boniface VIII.,
writes Dante in <i>Inferno</i> xix. He translated the
Papal Court from Rome to Avignon, and thus in
1305 initiated the Babylonian captivity of the
Popes, which lasted for more than seventy years,
“to the great damage of all Christendom, but
especially of Rome” (Platina). Scandalous as
was his subservience to the French king, and utterly
unworthy of the Papacy as he showed himself,
it must be admitted that Clement made serious
efforts to relieve the persecuted Bianchi and
Ghibellines—efforts which were cut short by the
surrender of Pistoia in 1306 and the incompetence
of his legate, the Cardinal Napoleone Orsini. In
October 1308, Corso Donati came to the violent
end mentioned as a prophecy in <i>Purg.</i> xxiv.; suspected,
with good reason, of aiming at the lordship
of Florence with the aid of the Ghibelline
captain, Uguccione della Faggiuola, whose daughter
he had married, he was denounced as a traitor
and killed in his flight from the city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dante Possibly at Paris.</span>—Villani tells us that
Dante, after exile, went to the Studio at Bologna,
and then to Paris and to many parts of the world.
The visit to Paris is also affirmed by Boccaccio,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
and it is not impossible that Dante went thither,
between 1307 and 1309, by way of the Riviera and
Provence. A highly improbable legend of his
presence at Oxford is based upon an ambiguous
line in a poetical epistle from Boccaccio to Petrarch
and the later testimony of Giovanni da
Serravalle at the beginning of the fifteenth century.
Dante’s stay in Paris has been seriously
questioned, and still remains uncertain. The University
of Paris was then the first in the world in
theology and scholastic philosophy. Boccaccio
tells us that the disputations which Dante sustained
there were regarded as most marvellous
triumphs of scholastic subtlety. According to
Giovanni da Serravalle (who has, however, placed
his Parisian experiences too early), Dante was
forced to return before taking the doctorate of
theology, for which he had already fulfilled the
preliminaries. He may have stayed in Paris until
1310, when tremendous events put an end to his
studies and imperatively summoned him back to
Italy.</p>


<h3>6. <i>The Invasion of Henry VII.</i></h3>

<p>“Lo, now is the acceptable time wherein arise
the signs of consolation and peace. For a new
day is breaking from the east, showing forth the
dawn which already is dispersing the darkness
of our long calamity; and already the eastern
breezes begin to blow, the face of heaven glows
red, and confirms the hopes of the nations with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
caressing calm. And we too shall see the looked-for
joy, we who have kept vigil through the long
night in the desert” (<i>Epist.</i> v. 1).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Election of Henry VII.</span>—On May 1st, 1308,
Albert of Austria, who, by his neglect of Italy, had
suffered the garden of the Empire to be desert,
was assassinated by his nephew (<i>Purg.</i> vi. 97-105).
In November, with the concurrence of the
Pope and in opposition to the royal house of
France, Henry of Luxemburg was elected Emperor.
In January 1309 he was crowned at Aix
as Henry VII.; in May 1310 he announced to the
Italian cities his intention of coming to Rome for
the imperial crown. Here was a true King of the
Romans and successor of Caesar, such as the
Italians had not recognised since the death of
Frederick II. (<i>Conv.</i> iv. 3). The saddle was no
longer empty; Italy had once more a king and
Rome a spouse. It is in the glory of this imperial
sunrise that Dante appears again, and, in the
letter just quoted to the Princes and Peoples of
Italy, his voice is heard, hailing the advent of this
new Moses, this most clement Henry, <i>divus Augustus
Caesar</i>, who is hastening to the nuptials,
illuminated in the rays of the Apostolic benediction.
The letter seems to have been written after
the beginning of September, when the Pope issued
an encyclical on Henry’s behalf, and before the
latter part of October 1310, when the Emperor
arrived in Italy. According to the fifteenth-century
historian, Flavio Biondo, Dante was at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
this time at Forlì with Scarpetta degli Ordelaffi.
In January 1311 Henry took the iron crown (or
its substitute) at Milan. Dante, sometime before
the end of March, paid his homage to the Emperor
(<i>Epist.</i> vii. 2): “I saw thee, as beseems Imperial
Majesty, most benignant, and heard thee most
clement, when that my hands handled thy feet
and my lips paid their debt. Then did my spirit
exult in thee, and I spoke silently with myself:
‘Behold the Lamb of God. Behold Him who hath
taken away the sins of the world.’”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">National Policy of Florence.</span>—The Emperor
himself shared the golden dream of the Italian
idealists, and, believing in the possibility of the
union of Church and Empire in a peaceful Italy
healed of her wounds, addressed himself ardently
to his impossible task, forcing cities to take back
their exiles, patching up old quarrels. Opposed
to him arises the less sympathetic figure of King
Robert of Naples, who, having succeeded his
father, Charles II., in May 1309, was preparing—though
still for a while negotiating on his own account
with Henry—to head the Guelf opposition.
While others temporised, Florence openly defied
the Emperor, insulted his envoys, and refused to
send ambassadors to his coronation. While the
Emperor put his imperial vicars into Italian
cities, as though he were another Frederick Barbarossa,
the Florentines drew closer their alliance
with Robert, formed a confederation of Guelf
cities, and aided with money and men all who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
made head against the German King. In spite of
the bitter language used by Dante in his letters,
modern historians have naturally recognised in
this one of the most glorious chapters in the history
of the Republic. “Florence,” writes Pasquale
Villari, “called on the Guelf cities, and all
seeking to preserve freedom and escape foreign
tyranny, to join in an Italian confederation, with
herself at its head. This is, indeed, the moment
in which the small merchant republic initiates a
truly national policy, and becomes a great Italian
power. So, in the medieval shape of a feudal and
universal Empire, on the one hand, and in that
of a municipal confederation on the other, a gleam
of the national idea first began to appear, though
still in the far distance and veiled in clouds.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Letters and Fresh Sentence.</span>—On March 31st,
1311, from “the boundaries of Tuscany under the
source of the Arno,” and on April 17th, from
“Tuscany under the source of the Arno,” Dante
addressed two terrible letters to “the most wicked
Florentines within,” and to “the most sacred
triumphant and only lord, Henry by divine providence
King of the Romans, ever Augustus.” In
the former he reasserts the rights and sanctity of
the Empire, and, whilst hurling the fiercest invective
upon the Florentine government, foretells
their utter destruction and warns them of their
inability to withstand the might of the Emperor.
In the latter he rebukes the “minister of God and
son of the Church and promoter of Roman glory”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
for his delay in Lombardy, and urges him on
against Florence, “the sick sheep that infects all
the flock of the Lord with her contagion.” Let
him lay her low and Israel will be delivered.
“Then shall our heritage, the taking away of
which we weep without ceasing, be restored to us
again; and even as we now groan, remembering
the holy Jerusalem, exiles in Babylon, so then, citizens
breathing again in peace, we shall look back
in our joy upon the miseries of confusion.” These
letters were evidently written from the Casentino,
where Dante had gone probably on an imperial
mission to one or other of the Conti Guidi. He
was perhaps staying at the castle of Poppi, and
there is a tradition that the Florentine government
sent agents to arrest him there. Probably
in consequence of these letters, a new condemnation
was pronounced against him; on September
2nd, 1311, Dante is included in the long list of
exiles who, in the “reform” of Baldo d’Aguglione,
are to be excepted from amnesty and for ever
excluded from Florence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Failure of the Emperor.</span>—But in the meantime
Brescia, “the lioness of Italy,” who had
offered as heroic a resistance to Henry VII. as
she was to do five centuries later to the Austrians
of Haynau, had been forced to surrender; and the
Emperor had at last moved southwards to Genoa
and thence to Pisa, from which parties of imperialists
ravaged the Florentine territory. From
Genoa, on December 24th, 1311, he issued a decree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
placing Florence under the ban of the Empire,
and declaring the Florentine exiles under his
special protection. Dante (with Palmieri Altoviti
and other exiles) was probably at Pisa in the early
spring of 1312, and it may well have been there
that Petrarch—then a little boy in his eighth year—saw
his great predecessor. Rome itself was
partly held by the troops of King Robert and the
Florentines; with difficulty was Henry crowned by
the Pope’s legates in the Church of St. John
Lateran on June 29th, 1312. From September
19th to October 31st Henry besieged Florence,
himself ill with fever. “Do ye trust in any defence
girt by your contemptible rampart?” Dante
had written to the Florentines: “What shall it
avail to have girt you with a rampart and to have
fortified yourselves with outworks and battlements,
when, terrible in gold, that eagle shall
swoop down on you which, soaring now over the
Pyrenees, now over Caucasus, now over Atlas,
ever strengthened by the support of the soldiery
of heaven, looked down of old upon vast oceans
in its flight?” But the golden eagle did not venture
upon an assault. Wasting the country as it
went, the imperial army retreated. Early in 1313
the Florentines gave the signory of their city to
King Robert for five years, while the Emperor
from Pisa placed the king under the ban of the
Empire, and declared him a public enemy. The
Pope himself had deserted the imperial cause,
and was fulminating excommunication if Henry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
invaded Robert’s kingdom (cf. <i>Par.</i> xvii. 82; xxx.
144), when the Emperor, moving from Pisa with
reinforcements from Germany and Sicily, died on
the march towards Naples at Buonconvento, near
Siena, on August 24th, 1313. Dante had not accompanied
the imperialists against Florence; he
yet retained so much reverence for his fatherland,
as Bruni writes, apparently from some lost letter
of the poet’s. We do not know where he was when
the fatal news reached him. Cino da Pistoia and
Sennuccio del Bene broke out into elegiac canzoni
on the dead hero; Dante was silent, and waited
till he could more worthily write the apotheosis
of his <i>alto Arrigo</i> in the Empyrean (<i>Par.</i> xxx.
133-138).</p>


<h3>7. <i>Last Period of Exile</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Dante’s Wanderings—Death of Clement V.</span>—Dante
was again a proscribed fugitive. His
movements are hardly known, excepting by more
or less happy conjecture, from the spring of 1311
in the Casentino to the close of his days at Ravenna.
Boccaccio and Bruni agree that he had now
given up all hope of return to Florence. According
to the latter, he wandered about in great
poverty, under the protection of various lords, in
different parts of Lombardy, Tuscany, and Romagna.
There is a tradition, perhaps mainly
based upon a passage in the <i>Paradiso</i> (<i>Par.</i> xxi.
106-120), that Dante retired to the convent of
Santa Croce di Fonte Avellana in the Apennines,
from which he gazed forth upon the perishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
world of the Middle Ages, which was finding imperishable
monument in his work. To this epoch
might possibly be assigned—for what it may be
worth—the story of his visit to the other convent
of Santa Croce del Corvo in Lunigiana in quest of
peace; but the only authority for this episode is
the letter of Frate Ilario to Uguccione della Faggiuola,
now almost universally regarded as a
fabrication. But, if his steps are hidden, his voice
is heard, and with no uncertain sound. On April
20th, 1314, Clement V. died in Provence (<i>Par.</i>
xxx. 145); and, early in the interregnum that followed,
Dante addressed a famous letter to the
Italian cardinals, rebuking them for their backsliding
and corruption, urging them to make
amends by striving manfully for the restoration
of the papacy to Rome. It is a noble production,
full of zeal and dignity, impregnated with the
sublimest spirit of mediaeval Catholicity. It had
no immediate effect; after a long interval the
Cahorsine, John XXII., was elected in August
1316; and the disgrace of Avignon continued.
The ideal Emperor had failed; no ideal Pope was
forthcoming; conscious at last of his own greatness,
with <i>luci chiare ed acute</i> (<i>Par.</i> xxii. 126),
eyes clear from passion and acute with discernment,
the divine poet turned to the completion of
his <i>Commedia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rejection of the Amnesty.</span>—After the death
of the Emperor, the Ghibelline leader, Uguccione
della Faggiuola, had been chosen lord of Pisa; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
captured Lucca in June, 1314, and began a brief
career of conquest in Tuscany which seriously
alarmed Florence. In this crisis the Florentine
government on May 19th, 1315, decreed a general
<i>ribandimento</i>, or recall of exiles, under condition
of a small fine, a merely formal imprisonment,
and the ceremony of “oblation” in the Baptistery.
Dante was probably at Lucca when he received
letters to the effect that he was included.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The
famous letter to a Florentine friend contains his
rejection of this amnesty. While deeply and
affectionately grateful to the friends who have
striven for his return, the conditions of this
“revocatio gratiosa” seem to Dante derogatory
to his fame and honour, and with calm dignity he
refuses to avail himself of it: “This is not the
way of return to our native land, my father; but
if another may be found, first by you and then by
others, which does not derogate from Dante’s
fame and honour, that will I accept with no lagging
feet. But, if by no such way Florence may
be entered, I will never enter Florence. What
then? May I not anywhere gaze upon the mirror
of the sun and stars? Can I not ponder on the
sweetest truths anywhere beneath the heaven, unless
first I return to the city, inglorious, nay dishonoured,
in the sight of the Florentine people?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
Nor, assuredly, will bread fail me” (Epist. ix 4).<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Condemnation.</span>—On August 29th, 1315,
Uguccione utterly defeated the united armies of
Florence and Naples at the great battle of Montecatini;
the Pisan ploughman had crushed the
flowers and the lilies, as Giovanni del Virgilio
afterwards wrote to Dante. Dante’s two sons,
Jacopo and Pietro, had perhaps joined him in
Lucca. The original death sentence had apparently
been commuted (probably because of his
having refrained from joining in the imperialist
attack upon Florence in 1312) to being placed under
bounds in some defined locality; and in October
1315 the poet, with his two sons, and others
were cited to appear before Ranieri di Zaccaria
of Orvieto, royal vicar in the city of Florence and
its district (King Robert’s vicars having replaced
the podestàs), to give surety as to going and staying
in the places appointed. On their neglecting
to appear, “Dante Alighieri and his sons,” in
Ranieri’s sentence of November 6th, are condemned
as contumacious and rebels, and sentenced
to be beheaded if they ever come into the power
of the royal vicar or of the Commune of Florence.
“And, lest they should glory in their contumacy,
we put all and each of them under ban of the city
of Florence and district, giving licence to anyone
to offend all and any one of them in goods and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
person, according to the form of the statutes of
Florence.” All the Portinari are included in this
decree, with the exception of Manetto and fourteen
others who have given security.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dante at Verona.</span>—In the following year, 1316,
Uguccione lost Pisa and Lucca, and fled to Verona,
where Can Grande della Scala, since the death of
his brother Albuino in 1311, held sovereign sway
as imperial vicar, and had become the champion
of Ghibellinism in northern Italy; in 1318 Cane
was elected captain of the Ghibelline League, and
in his service Uguccione died during the siege of
Padua in 1319 or 1320. It is probable that, somewhere
about this time, Dante’s wandering feet
had led him back to Verona to renew his friendship
with Can Grande (<i>Par.</i> xvii. 85-90; <i>Epist.</i>
x. 1). The old legend of Dante having met with
discourtesy at his hands is to be absolutely rejected,
as indeed every reference to Can Grande
in his works demands. That, on his earlier visit,
there may have been some unpleasantness with
Albuino (<i>Conv.</i> iv. 16) is more credible. But
Dante needed a more peaceful refuge than Verona
to complete his life’s work; the city of the imperial
vicar resounded with the clash of warlike
preparations:</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>
<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">At Ravenna.</span>—It was most likely towards the
end of 1316, or early in 1317, that Dante finally
settled at Ravenna; probably, as Boccaccio tells us,
on the invitation of Guido Novello da Polenta, who
had succeeded to the lordship of Ravenna in June
1316. This Guido was the nephew of Francesca
da Rimini, the hapless heroine of one of the most
familiar episodes of the <i>Inferno</i>. These few remaining
years of Dante’s life are the pleasantest
to contemplate. His two sons were with him,
though their mother apparently remained in
Florence. Dino Perini, a younger Florentine,
seems to have been to some extent the friend of
Dante’s later days, as Guido Cavalcanti had been
of his youth. And there were other congenial
companions round him, including perhaps Giotto,
who was probably working at Ravenna about this
time. It is possible that Dante held some kind of
professorship in the local university. Scholars
and disciples came to be instructed in the poetic
art, among them, it would seem, Guido da Polenta
himself. His relations were still cordial with Can
Grande, to whom, probably in 1318 or 1319, he
addressed the epistle which contains the dedication
of the <i>Paradiso</i>. From the <i>Quaestio de Aqua
et Terra</i> (which is now generally accepted as
authentic) we gather that, at the end of 1319 or
beginning of 1320, Dante paid a visit to Mantua,
and that at Verona, on January 20th, 1320, he
delivered a discourse concerning the relative position
of the two elements, earth and water, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
the globe’s surface. A curious document of 1320—the
report of a process at Avignon in which
Dante’s name is incidentally mentioned—seems to
show that the poet was regarded as an authority
upon sorcery, but as one whom persons intending
to put this power to guilty use should abstain from
consulting. There is also some vague evidence
that accusations of heresy may have been brought
against him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Last Days and Death.</span>—At Ravenna, amidst
the monuments of ancient Caesars and the records
in mosaic of primitive Christianity, where the
church walls testified the glory of Justinian and
the music of the Pine Forest sounded in his ears,
Dante finished his <i>Divina Commedia</i>. His poetical
correspondence with Giovanni del Virgilio,
a shining light of the University of Bologna, reveals
the kindliness and affability of the austere
“preacher of Justice.” But he was not to end
his days in peace. A storm cloud of war seemed
about to burst over Ravenna. According to Venetian
accounts—and we have no version of the
matter from the other side—the Ravennese had
taken Venetian ships and killed Venetian sailors
in time of peace without just cause. In consequence
the Doge entered into an alliance with the
lords of Forlì and Rimini, and prepared to make
war upon Ravenna with forces far beyond Guido’s
power to meet. In August 1321 an embassy was
sent by Guido to Venice, to avert the war by
diplomatic means. Of this embassy Dante formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
part. According to Filippo Villani, the Venetians
refused the poet a hearing, and forced him, sick
with fever, to return by land. It is more probable
that Dante returned with offered terms by the
quickest way, which would bring him back through
the Pineta to Ravenna. There he died in the night
between September 13th and 14th, 1321, in the
fifty-seventh year of his age. The poet of a
renovated Empire and a purified Church had
passed away on the feast of the Exaltation of the
Holy Cross—the Cross which he represents as
the mystical bond with which Christ had bound
the chariot of the Church to the tree of the Empire.
He left his Church sinking, though but for
a time, still deeper into the scandal and corruption
of Avignon; his Empire preparing new degradation
for itself, now that the Eagle had passed into
the greedy and unworthy hands of Bavarian
Louis; his Italy torn and rent by factions and
dissensions; his own Florence still ranking him
as a proscribed rebel and criminal. But the
divine work of his life had been completed, and
remains an everlasting proof of the doctrine
formulated by another poet, five hundred years
later: “Poets are the unacknowledged legislators
of the world.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<h3>8. <i>Dante’s Work and First Interpreters</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Four Periods in Human Life.</span>—In the <i>Convivio</i>
(iv. 23, 24) Dante represents human life under the
image of an arch, ascending and descending. For
the perfectly-natured the summit of this arch is in
the thirty-fifth year. Life is divided into four
ages, like the four seasons of the year. Adolescence,
<i>Adolescenza</i>, the increase of life, ascends
from birth to the twenty-fifth year; Youth or
Manhood, <i>Gioventute</i>, the perfection and culmination
of life, lasts from the twenty-fifth to the
forty-fifth year; Age, <i>Senettute</i>, descends from
the forty-fifth to the seventieth year; after which
remains Old Age, <i>Senio</i>, the winter of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Three Periods in Dante’s Work.</span>—Dante’s
work falls into three periods, representing to some
extent <i>Adolescenza</i>, <i>Gioventute</i>, <i>Senettute</i>. The
first is that of his “New Life,” the epoch of the
romantic worship of Beatrice in her life and after
her death, in which the youthful poet beheld many
things by his intellect, as it were dreaming, <i>quasi
come sognado</i> (<i>Conv.</i> ii. 13). This period comprises
the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, with the lyrics contemporaneous
with it, and closes in the promise “yet
to utter concerning her what hath never been said
of any woman.” The second period corresponds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
to Dante’s second age, or <i>Gioventute</i>; it is the
period in which the image of Beatrice in the
citadel of his mind is somewhat obscured by the
tempests of passion and political turmoil, and for
a while had become less paramount when her poet
directed his thoughts to the service of philosophical
research. Joined to the first period by
the canzone addressed to the angelic movers of
the sphere of Venus, it includes the greater part
of the collection of lyrics (Canzoni, Bellate, Sonnets)
included in the <i>Rime</i> or <i>Canzoniere</i>; the two
unfinished prose treatises which expound the
mystical meaning and technical construction of
these canzoni, the <i>Convivio</i> and the <i>De Vulgari
Eloquentia</i>. The three political letters connected
with the Italian expedition of Henry VII. and,
most probably, the special treatise in Latin prose
on the Empire, the <i>Monarchia</i>, connect the second
with the third period. This last period is the
period of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>; the return to
Beatrice, but now the allegorical Beatrice; the
fulfilment of the supreme promise of the <i>Vita
Nuova</i>; the result of the labours in art and philosophy
which the second period had witnessed, of
political experience, and of the spiritual and
moral revulsion of Dante’s later years, after the
bitter disillusion of the Emperor Henry’s enterprise
and failure: “A fruit of sufferings excess.”
To this period, subsidiary to the <i>Divina Commedia</i>,
belong the letters to the Italian Cardinals,
to the Florentine friend and to Can Grande, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
<i>Quaestio de Aqua et Terra</i> (if authentic), and the
two <i>Eclogues</i>.</p>

<p>In addition to these works, several Italian
scholars of high repute have attributed to Dante
the <i>Fiore</i>—a rendering of the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>
in 232 sonnets—the author of which twice calls
himself “Durante.” The editors of the sexcentenary
<i>testo critico</i> have wisely excluded it from
their volume, and it has been edited as an “appendice
dantiana” by Parodi. Also we know of several
smaller things of Dante’s now lost: the letters
mentioned by Leonardo Bruni and Flavio Biondo;
a <i>serventese</i> containing the names of the sixty
most beautiful women in Florence, referred to in
the <i>Vita Nuova</i> (<i>V. N.</i> vi.), one of his earliest
poems; and a canzone on love, of peculiar structure,
quoted in the <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i> (<i>V. E.</i>
ii. 11).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Early Commentators.</span>—No sooner had Dante

Boccaccio tells us that it was Dante’s custom to
send the <i>Divina Commedia</i> by instalments to Can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
Grande at Verona, and he adds a striking story
of how, eight months after his death, the poet
appeared in a vision, “clad in whitest garments
and his face shining with an unwonted light,” to
his son Jacopo, to reveal to the world where the
manuscript of the last thirteen cantos of the
<i>Paradiso</i> was hidden. It is a fact that in April or
May, 1322, Jacopo presented a complete copy of
the sacred poem to Guido da Polenta, who was
then Captain of the People at Bologna. Straightway
the work of copyists and commentators began,
above all at Florence and Bologna. The
earliest dated MSS. are the <i>Codice Landiano</i> at
Piacenza and the <i>Codice Trivulziano</i> at Milan
(the latter of Florentine origin), dated 1336 and
1337 respectively. Of commentaries, the first two
are those on the <i>Inferno</i>, written in the twenties
of the century, by Dante’s son, Jacopo Alighieri,
in Italian, and Ser Graziolo de’ Bambaglioli,
chancellor of the Commune of Bologna, in Latin.
The earliest extant commentators on the complete
poem are the Bolognese Jacopo della Lana and
the Florentine author of the <i>Ottimo Commento</i>,
probably Andrea Lancia; the former wrote shortly
before and the latter shortly after 1330. Both
wrote in Italian. Pietro Alighieri composed a
Latin commentary on his father’s work about
1340, and revised it, with additions, some years
later. An important Latin commentary on the
<i>Inferno</i>, by the Carmelite Guido da Pisa, dates
from the forties of the century. And, before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
fourteenth century closed, a new epoch in Dante
scholarship was inaugurated by the lectures and
commentaries of Giovanni Boccaccio at Florence
(1373), Benvenuto da Imola at Bologna (1375-80),
and Francesco da Buti at Pisa (1380-90). Of all
these earlier commentators, Benvenuto da Imola
is by far the greatest; and he unites mediaeval
Dantology with England’s cult of the divine poet
in the first complete edition of his commentary
which was given to the world by Lacaita and
William Warren Vernon.</p>

<p>In his proem, Ser Graziolo, or his contemporary
translator, strikes the keynote of all reverent
criticism of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, and defines the
attitude in which the divine poet and his works
should be approached:</p>

<p>“Although the unsearchable Providence of God
hath made many men blessed with prudence and
virtue, yet before all hath it put Dante Alighieri,
a man of noble and profound wisdom, true fosterling
of philosophy and lofty poet, the author of
this marvellous, singular, and most sapient work.
It hath made him a shining light of spiritual
felicity and of knowledge to the people and cities
of the world, in order that every science, whether
of heavenly or of earthly things, should be amply
gathered up in this public and famous champion
of prudence, and through him be made manifest
to the desires of men in witness of the Divine
Wisdom; so that, by the new sweetness and universal
matter of his song, he should draw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
souls of his hearers to self-knowledge, and that,
raised above earthly desires, they should come to
know not only the beauties of this great author,
but should attain to still higher grades of knowledge.
To him can be applied the text in Ecclesiasticus:
‘The great Lord will fill him with the
spirit of understanding, and he will pour forth
the words of his wisdom as showers.’”</p>

Stefano degli Ulivi at Ravenna. This Suora Beatrice is mentioned,
as no longer living, in a document of 1371. In a document
of 1332, the only children of the poet who appear, together with his widow Gemma, are Jacopo, Pietro, and
Antonia (of whom we know nothing more). It seems, therefore,
probable that Dante had one daughter, Antonia, who,
after 1332 (perhaps after the death of her mother), entered
religion at Ravenna as Suora Beatrice. See O. Bacci, “Beatrice

</div>



<h3>1. <i>The “Vita Nuova”</i></h3>

<p>Guido Guinizelli is acknowledged by Dante himself
as his master in poetic art and the founder
of the great new school of Italian poetry: “The
father of me and of the others, my betters, who
ever used sweet and gracious rhymes of love”
(<i>Purg.</i> xxvi. 97). Guido’s “Canzone of the Gentle
Heart”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Al cor gentil ripara sempre Amore,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“To the gentle heart doth Love ever repair,” the
first great Italian lyric of this <i>dolce stil nuovo</i>, set
forth an ideal creed of love which Dante made his
own, and is the most fitting introduction to the
<i>Vita Nuova</i> and the <i>Rime</i>. Love has its proper
dwelling in the gentle heart, as light in the sun,
for Nature created them simultaneously for each
other, and they cannot exist apart. “The fire of
Love is caught in gentle heart as virtue in the
precious stone, to which no power descends from
the star before the sun makes it a gentle thing.
After the sun has drawn forth from it all which
there is vile, the star gives it power. So the heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
which is made by Nature true, pure, and noble, a
woman like a star enamours.” But a base nature
will extinguish love as water does fire. Unless a
man has true gentlehood in his soul, no high birth
or ancient lineage will ennoble him. Even as God
fills the celestial intelligence with the Beatific
Vision of His Essence, so the <i>bella donna</i> inspires
him of gentle heart with the perfection of faithful
love. Nor need the poet fear to take divine things
as similitudes of his love, for such love as this is
celestial, and will be accepted in Paradise:</p>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="smcap">Rossetti’s</span> <i>Translation</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">The poetry of the <i>dolce stil nuovo</i> developed the
spiritual conception of love already in germ in the
later troubadours, and added an infusion of the
new scholastic philosophy, but the real novelty lay
in the superiority of Guido Guinizelli as a poet
over his predecessors. From Bologna the pre-eminence
passed to Florence with Guido Cavalcanti,
who took from the other Guido “la gloria
de la lingua” (<i>Purg.</i> xi. 98), and developed a complicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
poetical psychology which culminates in
his famous canzone on the nature of love:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Donna me prega, perch’io voglio dire;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“A lady prays me, therefore I would tell of an
accident which is often fierce and is so lofty that
it is called Love.” The <i>Vita Nuova</i>, beginning
under the influence of Cavalcanti, becomes the
supreme development in prose and verse of the
doctrine of Guinizelli.</p>

<p>“This glorious poet,” writes Boccaccio, “first,
when still weeping for the death of his Beatrice,
about in his twenty-sixth year put together in a
little volume, which he called the <i>New Life</i>, certain
small works, as sonnets and canzoni, made by
him in diverse times before and in rhyme, marvellously
beautiful; writing at the head of each,
severally and in order, the occasions which had
moved him to make them, and adding at the end
the divisions of each poem. And although, in
maturer years, he was much ashamed of having
made this little book, nevertheless, when his age
is considered, it is very beautiful and pleasing,
and especially to the general reader.”</p>

<p>But this spotless lily of books is too delicate a
flower in the garden of art to be plucked by the
hands of the writer of the <i>Decameron</i>. A greater
poet than Boccaccio has said of it: “Throughout
the <i>Vita Nuova</i> there is a strain like the first falling
murmur which reaches the ear in some remote
meadow, and prepares us to look upon the sea.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
It is a preparation for the <i>Commedia</i>, inasmuch
as it tells us how the divine singer became a poet,
and how she crossed his path who was to be his
spiritual pilot over that mighty ocean. Boccaccio’s
statement, that Dante in maturer years was
ashamed of having written this book, is perhaps
due to a misunderstanding or confused recollection
of a passage about certain canzoni in the
<i>Convivio</i> (i. 2). In the <i>Convivio</i>, where he discusses
the nature of allegory and interprets the
whole of certain later poems in an allegorical
sense, Dante suggests no such significance for
Beatrice in the <i>Vita Nuova</i>; but, while declaring
that the <i>Vita Nuova</i> was written at the entrance
of manhood, he seems to contrast it with his more
mature work, to which alone he would apply an
allegorical interpretation. And he is most emphatic
that this is in no way to derogate from the
<i>Vita Nuova</i> (<i>Conv.</i> i. 1): “For it is fitting to
speak and act differently in one age than in
another.”</p>

<p>The <i>Vita Nuova</i> is the most spiritual and
ethereal romance of love that exists, but its purity
is such as comes, not from innocent simplicity of
soul, but from self-repression. In the form of a
collection of lyrics connected together by a prose
narrative (itself a thing of rare and peculiar
beauty), with quaint and curious scholastic divisions
and explanations, Dante tells the tale of his
love for Beatrice, from his first sight of her in
their ninth year to a vision which is the anticipation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
of her final apotheosis. Although conforming
with the poetic conventions of the age, especially
in the earlier portions, it is based upon a real
love story, however deeply tinged with mysticism
and embellished with visionary episodes. The
heroine in her loveliness and purity becomes an
image upon earth of the Divine Beauty and Goodness;
the poet’s love for her is the stepping-stone
to love of the Supreme Good. Dante has learned
his lesson from Guido Guinizelli, and does not
fear to take God Himself as a similitude of his
love; Heaven itself requires his lady for its perfection
of beatitude (<i>V. N.</i> xix.); she has her
precursor in Monna Giovanna, even as St. John
came before the True Light (xxiv.); nay, she is
a very miracle whose only root is the Blessed
Trinity (xxx.).</p>

<p>Here beginneth the “New Life,” <i>Incipit vita
nova!</i> We shall probably do well in taking the
New Life not as merely meaning the poet’s youth,
but as referring to the new life that began with
the dawn of love, the regeneration of the soul.
Dante’s first meeting with Beatrice at the beginning
of her ninth and at the end of his ninth year,
when she appeared to him robed in crimson, the
colour of love and charity—and her “most sweet
salutation” nine years later, when she came
dressed all in pure white, the hue of Faith and
Purity, between two gentle ladies older than herself—these
things may have a certain analogy
with the representation of his moral and political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
conversion, in the vision of the <i>Commedia</i>, as
happening in his thirty-fifth year, 1300, the year
of Jubilee. We may perhaps surmise that Dante,
looking back from this second meeting, from which
his love really dates, artistically worked up the
recollections of his childhood to correspond with
it; just as many years later, when he turned to
the composition of the sacred poem, he looked
back in his memory to some great spiritual experience
when “in the middle of the journey of
our life.” And, although Dante’s own words in
the <i>Convivio</i> seem absolutely to preclude any possibility
of allegorising the figure of Beatrice herself,
it is clear that many of the minor episodes
in the <i>Vita Nuova</i> must be regarded as symbolical.</p>

<p>After the proem, in which the poet’s intention
is set forth, the <i>Vita Nuova</i> falls into three divisions.
Each contains ten poems set as gems in a
golden prose framework, the end of each part
being indicated by a reference to new matter,
<i>nuova matera</i> (xvii., xxxi.). The whole book is
closed by an epilogue containing one sonnet, <i>una
cosa nuova</i>, “a new thing,” with an introductory
episode and a visionary sequel. In the first part
Dante mainly depicts the effects in himself of
Beatrice’s beauty, the loveliness of the <i>belle membra</i>,
“the fair members in which I was enclosed”
(<i>Purg.</i> xxxi. 50); in the second, the miracles
wrought by the splendour of her soul; the third
contains his worship of her memory, when “the
delight of her fairness, departing from our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
view, became great spiritual beauty that spreads
through heaven a light of love, gives bliss to the
Angels, and makes their lofty and subtle intellect
wonder” (xxxiv.).</p>

<p>The first part (ii. to xvii.) contains nine of
Dante’s earliest sonnets and one ballata, with the
story of his youthful love up to a certain point,
where, after having passed through a spiritual
crisis, he resolves to write upon a new and nobler
matter than the past. We have the wondrous
effects of Beatrice’s salutation; the introductory
sonnet resulting in the friendship with Guido
Cavalcanti, to whom the book is dedicated, and
who seems to have induced Dante to write in
Italian instead of Latin (<i>V. N.</i> xxxi.); his concealment
of his love by feigning himself enamoured
of two other ladies. Throughout the
<i>Vita Nuova</i>, while Beatrice on earth or in heaven
is, as it were, the one central figure in the picture,
there is a lovely background of girlish faces behind
her; just as, in the paintings of many early
Italian masters, there is shown in the centre the
Madonna and her Divine Babe, while around her
all the clouds and sky are full of sweetly smiling
cherubs’ heads. There have been students of the
book who supposed that, while Beatrice represents
the ideal of womanhood, these others are
the real Florentine women in whom Dante for a
while sought this glorious ideal of his mind;
others have endeavoured in one or other of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
minor characters of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> to recognise
the Matelda of the Earthly Paradise. And there
are visions and dreams introduced, in which Love
himself appears in visible form, now as a lord of
terrible aspect within a cloud of fire with Beatrice
in his arms, now by a river-side in the garb of a
traveller to bid Dante feign love for another lady,
now as a youth clad in very white raiment to console
him when Beatrice refuses her salutation.
It may be that these two latter episodes mean that
Dante was for a time enamoured of some girl
whom he afterwards represented as the second
lady who shielded his real love from discovery,
and that he resolved to turn from it to a nobler
worship of Beatrice. The most beautiful sonnet
of this group is the fifth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Cavalcando l’altr’ier per un cammino,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“As I rode the other day along a path, thinking
of the journey that was irksome to me,” the journey
in question being probably to Bologna (cf.
p. 12).</p>

<p>This part is not wanting in the “burning tears”
which Leonardo Bruni finds such a stumbling-block
in Boccaccio’s narrative. Its lyrics show
the influence of Guido Cavalcanti, particularly in
the personification of the faculties of the soul as
<i>spiriti</i>, and in the somewhat extravagant metaphors
with which Dante depicts his torment in
love. But a complete change comes. The mysterious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
episode of Dante’s agony at a wedding
feast, where Beatrice mocks him, marks a crisis
in his new life. <i>Io tenni li piedi in quella parte
de la vita di là da la quale non si puote ire più per
intendimento di ritornare</i>, “I have set my feet on
that part of life beyond the which one can go no
further with intention of returning.” He crushes
the more personal element out of his love, and will
be content to worship her from afar; he has sufficiently
made manifest his own condition, even
if he should ever after abstain from addressing
her. “It behoved me to take up a new matter and
one nobler than the past.”</p>

<p>This <i>matera nuova e più nobile che la passata</i>
is the subject of the second part of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>
(xviii. to xxviii.). The poet’s youthful love has
become spiritual adoration for a living personification
of all beauty and nobleness. Since Beatrice
denies him her salutation, Love has placed
all his beatitude in those words that praise his
lady: so he tells the lady of very sweet speech,
<i>donna di motto leggiadro parlare</i>, who questions
him concerning this love, and whose rebuke marks
the turning-point of the whole book. And, for the
first time, the supreme poet is revealed in the
great canzone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Donne ch’avete intelletto d’amore,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Ladies that have understanding of love,” uniting
earth and heaven in glorification of her who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
the giver of blessing. Here the apotheosis of
womanhood, sketched by Guido Guinizelli, is developed
with mystical fullness, and there is even
perhaps a hint of some future work in honour
of Beatrice that will deal with the world beyond
the grave. The two sonnets that follow are a
kind of supplement; the first:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Amore e ’l cor gentil sono una cosa,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Love and the gentle heart are one same thing,”
gives a definition of love, elaborating the Guinizellian
doctrine; the second:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ne li occhi porta la mia donna Amore,</div>
  </div>

<p class="p0">“Within her eyes my lady carries Love,” pursues
the conception further, to represent Beatrice herself
as the creatrix of the divine gift of <i>gentilezza</i>
by which the heart is capable of noble love. Two
sonnets on the death of Beatrice’s father lead up
to a veritable lyrical masterpiece, the canzone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Donna pietosa e di novella etate,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“A lady pitiful and of tender age,” the anticipatory
vision of Beatrice’s death—the “Dante’s
Dream” of Rossetti’s famous picture. The following
sonnet, in which Beatrice and Cavalcanti’s
lady, Primavera or Giovanna, appear together, is
the only place in the <i>Vita Nuova</i> where Dante
calls her whom he loved by the name by which
she was actually known—“Bice.” Love now no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
longer appears weeping, but speaks joyfully in
the poet’s heart. All that was personal in Dante’s
worship seems to have passed away with his
earlier lamentations; his love has become a transcendental
rapture, an ecstasy of self-annihilation.
This part of the book culminates in the two
sonnets:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tanto gentile e tanto onesta pare,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“So noble and so pure seems my lady,” in which
a similar sonnet of Guinizelli’s is easily surpassed,
and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Vede perfettamente onne salute,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“He seeth perfectly all bliss, who beholds my lady
among the ladies”; sonnets which are flawless
gems of mediaeval poetry. Then abruptly, in the
composition of a canzone which should have shown
how Love by means of Beatrice regenerated his
soul, the pen falls from his hand: Beatrice has
been called by God to Himself, to be glorious under
the banner of Mary, “How doth the city sit
solitary that was full of people!”</p>

<p>Some falling off may be detected here and there
in the third part of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> (xxix. to xli.),
which includes the prose and poetry connected
with Beatrice’s death, the love for the lady who
takes pity upon the poet’s grief, his repentance
and return to Beatrice’s memory. A stately canzone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Li occhi dolenti per pietà del core,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>
<p class="p0">“The eyes that grieve for pity of the heart,” is a
companion piece to the opening canzone of the
second part; the poet now speaks of Beatrice’s
death in the same form and to the same love-illumined
ladies to whom he had formerly sung
her praises. More beautiful are the closing lines
of the shorter canzone, written for Dante’s second
friend, who was apparently Beatrice’s brother.
After the charming episode of the poet drawing
an Angel on her anniversary, the “gentle lady,
young and very fair,” inspires him with four sonnets;
and his incipient love for her is dispelled
by a “strong imagination,” a vision of Beatrice
as he had first seen her in her crimson raiment
of childhood. The bitterness of Dante’s repentance
is a foretaste of the confession upon Lethe’s
bank in the <i>Purgatorio</i>. The pilgrims pass
through the city on their way to Rome, “in that
season when many folk go to see that blessed likeness
which Jesus Christ left us as exemplar of
His most beauteous face, which my lady sees in
glory” (<i>V. N.</i> xli.); and this third part closes
with the sonnet in which Dante calls upon the
pilgrims to tarry a little, till they have heard how
the city lies desolate for the loss of Beatrice.</p>

<p>In the epilogue (xlii., xliii.), in answer to the
request of two of those noble ladies who throng
the ways of Dante’s mystical city of youth and
love as God’s Angels guard the terraces of the
Mount of Purgation, Dante writes the last sonnet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
of the book; wherein a “new intelligence,”
born of Love, guides the pilgrim spirit beyond the
spheres into the Empyrean to behold the blessedness
of Beatrice. It is an anticipation of the
spiritual ascent of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, which is
confirmed in the famous passage which closes the
“new life” of Love:</p>

<p>“After this sonnet there appeared unto me a
wonderful vision: wherein I saw things which
made me purpose to say no more of this blessed
one, until such time as I could discourse more
worthily concerning her. And to attain to that I
labour all I can, even as she knoweth verily.
Wherefore if it shall be His pleasure, through
whom is the life of all things, that my life continue
for some years, I hope that I shall yet utter concerning
her what hath never been said of any woman.
And then may it seem good unto Him, who
is the Lord of courtesy, that my soul may go hence
to behold the glory of its lady: to wit, of that
blessed Beatrice who gazeth gloriously upon the
countenance of Him who is blessed throughout
all ages.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>From the mention of the pilgrimage, and this
wonderful vision, it has been sometimes supposed
that the closing chapters of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
written in 1300. It seems, however, almost certain
that there is no reference whatever to the
year of Jubilee in the first case. When Dante’s
positive statement in the <i>Convivio</i>, that he wrote
the <i>Vita Nuova</i> at the entrance of manhood (<i>gioventute</i>
being the twenty years from twenty-five
to forty-five, <i>Conv.</i> iv. 24), is compared with the
internal evidence of the book itself, the most probable
date for its completion would be between
1291 and 1293. It should, however, be borne in
mind that, while there is documentary evidence
that some of the single poems were in circulation
before 1300, none of the extant manuscripts of
the whole work can be assigned to a date much
earlier than the middle of the fourteenth century.
It is, therefore, not inconceivable that the reference
to the vision may be associated with the
spiritual experience of 1300 and slightly later
than the rest of the book.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The form of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, the setting of the
lyrics in a prose narrative and commentary, is
one that Dante may well have invented for himself.
If he had models before his eyes, they were
probably, on the one hand, the <i>razos</i> or prose explanations
which accompanied the poems of the
troubadours, and, on the other, the commentaries
of St. Thomas Aquinas on the works of Aristotle,
which Dante imitates in his divisions and analyses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
of the various poems. His quotations show
that he had already studied astronomy, and made
some rudimentary acquaintance with Aristotle
and with the four chief Latin poets; the section
in which he speaks of the latter, touching upon
the relations between classical and vernacular poetry
(xxv.), suggests the germ of the <i>De Vulgari
Eloquentia</i>. The close of the book implies that
he regarded lack of scientific and literary equipment
as keeping him from the immediate fulfilment
of the greater work that he had even then
conceived for the glory of Beatrice.</p>

<p>In the <i>Convivio</i>, where all else is allegorical,
Beatrice is still simply his first love, <i>lo primo
amore</i> (ii. 16). Even when allegorically interpreting
the canzone which describes how another lady
took her place in his heart, after her death, as
referring to Philosophy, there is no hint of any
allegory about <i>quella viva Beatrice beata</i>, “that
blessed Beatrice, who lives in heaven with the
Angels and on earth with my soul” (<i>Conv.</i> ii. 2).
When about to plunge more deeply into allegorical
explanations, he ends what he has to say concerning
her by a digression upon the immortality of
the soul (<i>Conv.</i> ii. 9): “I so believe, so affirm,
and so am certain that I shall pass after this to
another better life, there where that glorious lady
lives, of whom my soul was enamoured.”</p>

<p>Those critics who question the reality of the
story of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, or find it difficult to accept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
without an allegorical or idealistic interpretation,
are best answered in Dante’s own words:
<i>Questo dubbio è impossibile a solvere a chi non
fosse in simile grado fedele d’Amore; e a coloro
che vi sono è manifesto ciò che solverebbe le
dubitose parole</i>; “This difficulty is impossible to
solve for anyone who is not in similar grade faithful
unto Love; and to those who are so, that is
manifest which would solve the dubious words”
(<i>V. N.</i> xiv.).</p>


<h3>2. <i>The “Rime”</i></h3>

<p>The <i>Rime</i>—for which the more modern title,
<i>Canzoniere</i>, has sometimes been substituted—comprise
all Dante’s lyrical poems, together with
others that are more doubtfully attributed to him.
In the <i>Vita Nuova</i> were inserted three canzoni,
two shorter poems in the canzone mould, one ballata,
twenty-five sonnets (including two double
sonnets). The “testo critico” of the <i>Rime</i>, edited
by Michele Barbi for the sexcentenary Dante, in
addition to these accepts as authentic sixteen canzoni
(the sestina is merely a special form of canzone),
five ballate, thirty-four sonnets, and two
stanzas. Dante himself regards the canzone as
the noblest form of poetry (<i>V. E.</i> ii. 3), and he
expounded three of his canzoni in the <i>Convivio</i>.
From the middle of the fourteenth century onwards,
a large number of MSS. give these three
and twelve others (fifteen in all) as a connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
whole in a certain definite order, frequently with
a special rubric in Latin or Italian prefixed to
each; this order and these rubrics are due to Boccaccio.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
It has been more difficult to distinguish
between the certainly genuine and the doubtful
pieces among the ballate and sonnets, and the
authenticity of some of those now included by
Barbi in the canon is still more or less open to
question. The <i>Rime</i>, on the whole, are the most
unequal of Dante’s works; a few of the sonnets,
particularly some of the earlier ones and those in
answer to other poets, have but slight poetic merit,
while several of the later canzoni rank among the
world’s noblest lyrics. In the sexcentenary edition
the arrangement of the lyrics is tentatively
chronological, with subsidiary groupings according
to subject-matter. While following the same
general scheme, I slightly modify the arrangement,
as certain poems regarded by Barbi as “rime
d’amore” appear to me to be more probably allegorical.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A first group belongs to the epoch of the
<i>Vita Nuova</i>. Conspicuous among them are two
canzoni. One:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">La dispietata mente che pur mira,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Pitiless memory that still gazes back at the time
gone by,” is addressed directly to a woman (in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
this respect differing from Dante’s other canzoni),
who is probably the second lady represented
as the poet’s screen. The other:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">E ’m’ incresce di me si duramente,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“I grieve for myself so bitterly,” seems to give
fuller expression to the first part of the <i>Vita
Nuova</i> with an alien note—the image of the little
maiden has yielded to that of the woman whose
great beauty is the object of unattainable desire.
At times a lighter note is struck; Dante is apparently
simply supplying words for composers
to set to music, or revealing a spirit of playfulness
of which there is no trace in the <i>Vita
Nuova</i>.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Besides sonnets in honour of Beatrice,
we have a few relating to other women, and in
two ballate even their names are given: Fioretta
and Violetta. One delightful sonnet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sonar bracchetti e cacciatori aizzare,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Beagles questing and huntsmen urging on,” reveals
the poet taking part in sport and appreciating
a jape at his own expense. A number of
correspondence sonnets belong to this epoch, a
small series addressed to Dante da Maiano (of
which no MS. has been preserved) being probably
earlier than the first sonnet of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
note of pure romance is struck in the charming
sonnet to Guido Cavalcanti, in which the younger
poet wishes that they two, with Lapo Gianni and
their three ladies (Dante’s being the first lady
who screened his love), might take a voyage over
enchanted seas in Merlin’s magic barque. Several
admirable sonnets, now included in this group,
were formerly attributed to Cino da Pistoia.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The tenzone with Forese Donati forms a
little group apart. Its date is uncertain, but may
be plausibly taken as between 1290 and 1296.
These sonnets, though not free from bitterness
which is perhaps serious, may be regarded as exercises
in that style of burlesque and satirical
poetry to which even Guido Guinizelli had once
paid tribute, and which Rustico di Filippo had
made characteristically Florentine.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Next comes a group of poems, connected
with the allegory of the <i>Convivio</i>, in which an
intellectual ideal is pursued with the passion and
wooed in the language of the lover who adores an
earthly mistress. “I say and affirm that the lady,
of whom I was enamoured after my first love,
was the most beautiful and most pure daughter of
the Emperor of the Universe, to whom Pythagoras
gave the name Philosophy” (<i>Conv.</i> ii. 16).
By some, not entirely reconcilable, process the
<i>donna gentile</i>, who appears at the end of the <i>Vita
Nuova</i>, has become a symbol of Philosophy, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
the poet’s love for her a most noble devotion. The
canzone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Voi che ’ntendendo il terzo ciel movete,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Ye who by understanding move the third
heaven” describing the conflict in Dante’s mind
between this new love and the memory of Beatrice,
deals again with the matter of one of the
sonnets of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>; but the allegory is
perhaps an after-thought. It is commented
upon in the second treatise of the <i>Convivio</i> and
quoted in Canto viii. of the <i>Paradiso</i>. The other
poems of this group seem purely allegorical:
“By love, in this allegory, is always intended that
study which is the application of the enamoured
mind to that thing of which it is enamoured”
(<i>Conv.</i> ii. 16). At first this service is painful and
laborious; and the mystical lady seems a cruel and
proud mistress, as she is represented in the
“pitiful ballata”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Voi che savete ragionar d’Amore,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Ye who know how to discourse of love,” which
is referred to in the third treatise of the <i>Convivio</i>
(iii. 9). But the defect is on the lover’s own part,
and in her light the difficulties which sundered him
and her are dispersed like morning clouds before
the face of the sun. This mystical worship culminates
in the supreme hymn to his spiritual mistress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
whose body is Wisdom and whose soul is
Love:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Love that in my mind discourses to me of my
lady desirously,” which is the second canzone of
the <i>Convivio</i> (quoted in <i>V. E.</i> ii. 6), the amorous
song that Casella was to sing “met in the milder
shades of Purgatory.” It is one of Dante’s lyrical
masterpieces. Hardly less beautiful is the
canzone, likewise cited in the <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>
(<i>V. E.</i> ii. 5, II):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Amor, che movi tua vertù dal cielo,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Love that movest thy power from heaven”; with
a mystical comparison of the workings of love to
those of the sun and striking lines on the supernatural
power of the illumined imagination. This
allegorical group may be regarded as closed by
the canzone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Io sento si d’Amor la gran possanza,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“I feel so the great power of love,” in which
Dante represents himself as too young to obtain
his lady’s grace, but is content to serve on, finding
the quest of philosophic truth its own reward.
This poem has two <i>commiati</i> (the <i>commiato</i>, or
<i>tornata</i>, being the stanza or part of a stanza, or
a few independent lines, added as an address<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
or farewell at the end of a canzone); both seem
to imply that philosophic verse may be the instrument
of political or social reform.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Dante originally held that Italian poetry
should only be used for writing upon love, and
therefore, in his younger days, a philosophical
poem would naturally take the form of a love ode.
In the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, he argues “against those who
rhyme upon any matter other than amorous; seeing
that such mode of speech was originally found
for speaking of love” (<i>V. N.</i> xxv). His views
naturally widened before he wrote his later canzoni
(<i>cf. V. E.</i> ii. 2); but when, lacking inspiration for
a higher lyrical flight or baffled by some metaphysical
problem, he turns to set erring men right
in didactic canzoni on some humbler ethical subject,
he represents himself as so doing because out
of favour with his lady or deserted by love. Thus,
“The sweet rhymes of love, which I was wont to
seek in my thoughts, needs must I leave”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Le dolci rime d’amor, ch’i’ solia</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">—opens the canzone on the spiritual nature of true
<i>gentilezza</i> (inspired in part by Guinizelli), which
is expounded in the fourth treatise of the <i>Convivio</i>,
and, although somewhat unequal, contains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
one ineffable stanza upon the noble soul in life’s
four stages. A companion poem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Poscia ch’Amor del tutto m’ ha lasciato,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Since love has left me utterly,” deals with <i>leggiadria</i>,
the outward expression of a chivalrous
soul, and shows the influence of the <i>Tesoretto</i> of
Brunetto Latini. These two canzoni, which contain
transcripts from the Aristotelian <i>Ethics</i>,
only here and there become poetry. In the larger
proportion of short lines in the stanza, Dante
seems feeling his way to a more popular metrical
form and a freer treatment, as well as a wider
range of subject. The second has satirical
sketches of vicious or offensive types of men, with
whom he will deal more severely in the <i>Commedia</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) There are certain lyrics of Dante’s which
can hardly admit of an allegorical interpretation,
but are almost certainly the expression of passionate
love for real women. Most notable among
these are a group of four canzoni, known as the
<i>rime per la donna pietra</i>, which are characterised
by a peculiar incessant playing upon the word
<i>pietra</i>, or “stone,” which has led to the hypothesis
that they were inspired by a lady named
Pietra, or at least by one who had been as cold
and rigid as Beatrice had been the giver of blessing.
The canzone of the <i>aspro parlare</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Così nel mio parlar voglio esser aspro,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>
<p class="p0">“So in my speech would I be harsh, as this fair
stone is in her acts,” shows that Dante could be
as terrible in his love as in his hate, and has a
suggestion of sensuality which we hardly find
elsewhere in his poetry. It is indirectly referred
to in the <i>Convivio</i>, and quoted by Petrarch. The
other three canzoni of this “stony” group show
very strongly the influence of the Provençal
Arnaut Daniel in their form, and all their imagery
is drawn from nature in winter. The sestina:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Al poco giorno e al gran cerchio d’ombra,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“To the short day and the large circle of shade
have I come,” is the first Italian example of that
peculiar variety of the canzone which was invented
by Arnaut (<i>V. E.</i>, ii. 10, 13). It gives a
most wonderful picture of this strange green-robed
girl, her golden hair crowned with grass
like Botticelli’s Libyan Sibyl, in the meadow
“girdled about with very lofty hills.” Less
beautiful and more artificial, the canzone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Amor, tu vedi ben che questa donna,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Love, thou seest well that this lady cares not
for thy power,” is likewise quoted with complacency,
for its novelty and metrical peculiarity, in
the <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i> (ii. 13). And the
passion of the whole group is summed up in the
poem on Love and Winter:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Io son venuto al punto de la rota,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>
<p class="p0">“I am come to the point of the wheel,” where,
stanza by stanza, the external phenomena of the
world in winter are contrasted with the state of
the poet’s soul, ever burning in the “sweet martyrdom”
of love’s fire. It is the ultimate perfection
of a species of poem employed by Arnaut and
other troubadours; another lyrical masterpiece,
anticipating in its degree the treatment of nature
which we find in the <i>Commedia</i>. These four
poems were probably composed shortly before
Dante’s banishment, but another canzone of somewhat
similar tone was certainly written in exile—the
famous and much discussed “mountain song”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Amor, da che convien pur ch’io mi doglia,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Love, since I needs must make complaint,”
apparently describing an overwhelming passion
for the fair lady of the Casentino; its pathetic
close, with its reference to Florence, has been already
quoted. The striking sonnet to Cino da
Pistoia about the same time:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Io sono stato con Amore insieme.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“I have been in company with love since the
circling of my ninth sun,” affords further testimony
that, at certain epochs of his life, earthly
love took captive Dante’s freewill.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) To the earlier years of Dante’s exile belongs
the noblest and most sublime of his lyrics, the
canzone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tre donne intorno al cor mi son venute,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>
<p class="p0">“Three ladies are come around my heart and are
seated without, for within sits Love who is in
lordship of my life.” They are Justice and her
spiritual children; Love prophesies the ultimate
triumph of righteousness, and the poet, with such
high companionship in outward misfortune, declares
that he counts his exile as an honour. While
recalling the legend of the apparition of Lady
Poverty and her two companions to St. Francis
of Assisi, and a poem of Giraut de Borneil on the
decay of chivalry, the canzone echoes Isaiah (ch.
li.). Its key may be found in the prophet’s words:
“Hearken unto me, ye that know Justice, the
people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the
reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their
revilings.” It was probably written between 1303
and 1306; its opening lines have been found transcribed
in a document of 1310.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> To about the
same epoch must be assigned the powerful canzone
against vice in general and avarice in particular:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Doglia mi reca ne lo core ardire,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Grief brings daring into my heart,” which is
cited in the <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i> (associated
with another poem of Giraut de Borneil) as a
typical poem on <i>rectitudo</i>, “righteousness,” “the
direction of the will” (<i>V. E.</i> ii. 2). These two
canzoni are the connecting link between the <i>Rime</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
and the <i>Commedia</i>; the first contains the germ of
Dante’s prophecy of the <i>Veltro</i>, his Messianic
hope of the Deliverer to come, who shall make
Love’s darts shine with new lustre and renovate
the world; in the second, we already catch the first
notes of the <i>saeva indignatio</i> of the sacred poem.
With the exception of the “montanina canzone”
and some sonnets to Cino da Pistoia, Dante wrote
few other lyrics at this period<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>; indeed, one of the
sonnets seems to imply that he had finally turned
away from such poetry (<i>da queste nostre rime</i>)
in contemplation of his greater task:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Io mi credea del tutto esser partito,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“I deemed myself to have utterly departed from
these our rhymes, Messer Cino, for henceforth
another path befits my ship and further from the
shore.”</p>


<h3>3. <i>The “Convivio”</i></h3>

<p>The <i>Convivio</i>, or “Banquet,” bears a somewhat
similar relation to the work of Dante’s second
period as the <i>Vita Nuova</i> did to that of his adolescence.
Just as after the death of Beatrice he collected
his earlier lyrics, furnishing them with
prose narrative and commentary, so now in exile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
he intended to put together fourteen of his later
canzoni and write a prose commentary upon them,
to the honour and glory of his mystical lady,
Philosophy. Dante was certainly not acquainted
with Plato’s <i>Symposium</i>. It was from the <i>De
Consolatione Philosophiae</i> of Boëthius that the
idea came to him of representing Philosophy as a
woman; but the “woman of ful greet reverence
by semblaunt,” who “was ful of so greet age,
that men ne wolde nat trowen, in no manere, that
she were of oure elde” (so Chaucer renders
Boëthius), is transformed to the likeness of a
<i>donna gentile</i>, the idealised human personality
of the poetry of the “dolce stil nuovo”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And I imagined her fashioned as a gentle lady;
and I could not imagine her in any bearing save
that of compassion; wherefore so willingly did the
sense of truth look upon her, that scarcely could
I turn it from her. And from this imagining I
began to go there where she revealed herself in
very sooth, to wit, in the schools of religious and
at the disputations of philosophers; so that in a
short time, perchance of thirty months, I began
to feel so much of her sweetness, that her love
drove out and destroyed every other thought”
(<i>Conv.</i> ii. 13).</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Convivio</i> is an attempt to bring philosophy
out of the schools of religious and away from the
disputations of philosophers, to render her beauty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
accessible even, to the unlearned. “The <i>Convivio</i>”,
says Dr. Wicksteed, “might very well be
described as an attempt to throw into popular
form the matter of the Aristotelian treatises of
Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas.” Dante’s
text is the opening sentence of Aristotle’s
<i>Metaphysics</i>: “All men by nature desire to
know”; which he elaborates from the commentary
of Aquinas and the latter’s <i>Summa contra gentiles</i>.
He would gather up the crumbs which fall
from the table where the bread of Angels is eaten,
and give a banquet to all who are deprived of this
spiritual food. It is the first important work
on philosophy written in Italian—an innovation
which Dante thinks necessary to defend in the
chapters of the introductory treatise, where he
explains his reasons for commenting upon these
canzoni in the vernacular instead of Latin, and
incidentally utters an impassioned defence of his
mother-tongue, with noteworthy passages on the
vanity of translating poetry into another language
and the potentialities of Italian prose (<i>Conv.</i> i.
7, 10).</p>

<p>In addition to this principal motive for writing
the work, the desire of giving instruction, Dante
himself alleges another—the fear of infamy,
<i>timore d’infamia</i> (<i>Conv.</i> i. 2): “I fear the infamy
of having followed such great passion as
whoso reads the above-mentioned canzoni will conceive
to have held sway over me; the which infamy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
ceases entirely by the present speaking of myself,
which shows that not passion, but virtue, has been
the moving cause.” It would seem that Dante
intended to comment upon certain of the canzoni
connected with real women, and to represent them
as allegorical; it may be that, consumed with a
more than Shelleyan passion for reforming the
world, he chose this method of getting rid of certain
episodes in the past which he, with too much
self-severity, regarded as rendering him unworthy
of the sublime office he had undertaken. And, by
a work of lofty style and authority, he would rehabilitate
the man who, in his exiled wanderings,
had “perchance cheapened himself more than
truth wills” (i. 4).</p>

<p>Only the introductory treatise and three of the
commentaries were actually written: those on the
canzoni <i>Voi cite ’ntendendo</i>, <i>Amor che ne la
mente mi ragiona</i>, <i>Le dolci rime d’amor</i>. If the
whole work had been completed on the same scale
as these four treatises, a great part of the field of
knowledge open to the fourteenth century would
have been traversed in the ardent service of this
mystical lady, whom the poet in the second
treatise—not without considerable inconsistency—represents
as the same as the <i>donna gentile</i> who
appeared towards the end of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>
(<i>Conv.</i> ii. 2). As it is, the movements of the
celestial bodies, the ministry of the angelic orders,
the nature of the human soul and the grades of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
psychic life, the mystical significance and universality
of love, are among the subjects discussed in
the second and third treatises. The fourth treatise
is primarily ethical: nobility as inseparable from
love and virtue, wealth, the Aristotelian definition
of moral virtue and human felicity, the goal of
human life, the virtues suitable to each age, are
among the themes considered. Under one aspect
the <i>Convivio</i> is a vernacular encyclopaedia (like
the <i>Trésor</i> of Brunetto Latini), but distinguished
from previous mediaeval works of the kind by its
peculiar form, its artistic beauty, and its personal
note. From the first treatise it is evident that the
whole work had been fully planned; but it is not
possible to reconstruct it with any plausibility,
or to decide upon the question of which of the
extant canzoni were to be included, and in what
order. From iv. 26, it may be conjectured that the
passionate canzone, <i>Così nel mio parlar voglio
esser aspro</i> (<i>Rime</i> ciii., O. canz. xii.), was to be
allegorised in the seventh treatise; while, from i.
12, ii. 1, iv. 27, it appears fairly certain that the
canzone of the three ladies, <i>Tre donne intorno
al cor</i> (<i>Rime</i> civ., O. canz. xx.), would have been
expounded in the fourteenth, where Justice and
Allegory were to have been discussed; and, from
i. 8 and iii. 15, that the canzone against the vices,
<i>Doglia mi reca</i> (<i>Rime</i> cvi., O. canz. x.), was destined
for the poetical basis of the last treatise of
all. It is thus clear that the <i>Convivio</i> would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
ended with the two canzoni which form the connecting
link between the lyrical poems and the
<i>Divina Commedia</i>. For the rest, it is certain that
there would have been no mention of Beatrice in
any of the unwritten treatises. In touching upon
the immortality of the soul (<i>Conv.</i> ii. 9), Dante had
seen fit to end what he wished to say of “that living
blessed Beatrice, of whom I do not intend to
speak more in this book.” There seems also good
reason for supposing that the canzone for the
beautiful lady of the Casentino (<i>Rime</i> cxvi., O.
canz. xi.), which may be of a slightly later date
than the others, would not have formed part of
the completed work.</p>

<p>Witte and others after him have supposed that
the <i>Convivio</i> represents an alienation from Beatrice;
that the Philosophy, which Dante defines as
the amorous use of wisdom, is a presumptuous
human science leading man astray from truth and
felicity along the dangerous and deceptive paths
of free speculation. There is, however, nothing
in the book itself to support this interpretation,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
and, indeed, a comparison between the second canzone,
<i>Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona</i>, and the
first canzone of the <i>Vita Nuova</i> points to the conclusion
that the personification of philosophy is
but a phase in the apotheosis of Beatrice herself.
The <i>Convivio</i> is the first fruit of Dante’s labours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
to fulfil the promise made at the end of the book
of his youth; his knowledge of literature and
philosophy has immeasurably widened, his speculations
on human life and nature have matured,
and his prose style, in its comparative freedom
and variety, its articulation and passages of
spontaneous eloquence, shows a vast progress
from that of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>.</p>

<p>There are passages in the <i>Convivio</i> which appear
to be contradicted in the <i>Divina Commedia</i>.
One of the most curious is the treatment of Guido
da Montefeltro, who, in <i>Conv.</i> iv. 28, is “our most
noble Italian,” and a type of the noble soul returning
to God in the last stage of life, whereas,
in the <i>Inferno</i> (Canto xxvii.), he is found in the
torturing flames of the evil counsellors. Several
opinions are directly or indirectly withdrawn in
the <i>Paradiso</i>; but these are to be rather regarded
as mistakes which, in the light of subsequent
knowledge, Dante desired to rectify or repudiate;
such as the theory of the shadow on the moon
being caused by rarity and density, based upon
Averroës, and a peculiar arrangement of the
celestial hierarchies, derived from the <i>Moralia</i> of
St. Gregory the Great. And, in the <i>Purgatorio</i>,
the poet discards his “dread of infamy,” when he
dares not meet Beatrice’s gaze in the Garden of
Eden; he casts aside the allegorical veil he had
tried to draw over a portion of the past, and makes
the full confession which we find in Cantos xxx.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
and xxxi. In the fourth treatise, an erroneous
sentence attributed to Frederick II. (in reality a
mutilated version of the definition of nobility
given by Aristotle in the <i>Politics</i>) leads Dante to
examine the limits and foundation of the imperial
authority, the divine origin of Rome and the universal
dominion of the Roman people, the relation
of philosophy to government; a theme which he
will work out more fully and scientifically in the
<i>Monarchia</i>. The result is two singularly beautiful
chapters (iv.-v.); a prose hymn to Rome, an
idealised history of the city and her empire. It
is the first indication of the poet’s conversion from
the narrower political creed of the Florentine
citizen to the ideal imperialism which inspires his
later works.</p>

<p>It has sometimes been held that portions of the
<i>Convivio</i> were written before exile. Nevertheless,
while two of the canzoni were composed before
1300, it seems most probable that the prose commentaries
took their present shape between Dante’s
breaking with his fellow-exiles and the advent
of Henry VII. A passage concerning Frederick
II., “the last emperor of the Romans with respect
to the present time, although Rudolph and Adolph
and Albert were elected after his death and that
of his descendants” (<i>Conv.</i> iv. 3), shows that the
fourth treatise was written before the election of
Henry VII., in November 1308; while a reference
to Gherardo da Cammino, lord of Treviso (iv. 14),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
seems to have been written after his death in
March 1306. From the mention of Dante’s wanderings
in exile through so many regions of Italy
(i. 3), it has sometimes been argued that the first
is later than the subsequent treatises. It is tempting
to associate the breaking off the work with
Boccaccio’s story of the recovery of the beginning
of the <i>Inferno</i>. Be that as it may, the advent of
the new Caesar, Dante’s own return for a while
to political activity, probably interrupted his life
of study; and, when the storm passed away and
left the poet disillusioned, his ideals had changed,
another world lay open to his gaze, and the <i>Convivio</i>
was finally abandoned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br>DANTE’S LATIN WORKS</h2>
</div>



<h3>1. <i>The “De Vulgari Eloquentia”</i></h3>

<p>In the first treatise of the <i>Convivio</i> (i. 5), Dante
announces his intention of making a book upon
<i>Volgare Eloquenza</i>, artistic utterance in the vernacular.
Like the <i>Convivio</i>, the <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>
remains incomplete; only two books, instead
of four, were written, and of these the
second is not finished. In the first book the poet
seeks the highest form of the vernacular, a perfect
and imperial Italian language, to rule in unity and
concord over all the dialects, as the Roman Empire
over all the nations; in the second book he was
proceeding to show how this illustrious vulgar
tongue should be used for the art of poetry. Villani’s
description of the work applies only to the
first book: “Here, in strong and ornate Latin,
and with fair reasons, he reproves all the dialects
of Italy”; Boccaccio’s mainly to the second: “A
little book in Latin prose, in which he intended to
give instruction, to whoso would receive it, concerning
composition in rhyme.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Book I.</span>—At the outset Dante strikes a slightly
different note from that of the <i>Convivio</i>, by boldly
asserting that vernacular in general (as the natural
speech of man) is nobler than “grammar,”
literary languages like Latin or Greek, which he
regards as artificially formed (<i>V. E.</i> i. 1). To discover
the noblest form of the Italian vernacular,
the poet starts from the very origin of language
itself. To man alone of creatures has the intercourse
of speech been given: speech, the rational
and sensible sign needed for the intercommunication
of ideas. Adam and his descendants spoke
Hebrew until the confusion of Babel (<i>cf.</i> the
totally different theory in <i>Par.</i> xxvi. 124), after
which this sacred speech remained only with the
children of Heber (i. 2-7). From this point onwards
the work becomes amazingly modern. Of
the threefold language brought to Europe after
the dispersion, the southernmost idiom has varied
into three forms of vernacular speech—the language
of those who in affirmation say <i>oc</i> (Spanish
and Provençal), the language of <i>oil</i> (French), the
language of <i>sì</i> (Italian).<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> And this Italian vulgar
tongue has itself varied into a number of dialects,
of which Dante distinguishes fourteen groups,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
none of which represent the illustrious Italian
language which he is seeking. “He attacks,”
wrote Mazzini, “all the Italian dialects, but it is
because he intends to found a language common
to all Italy, to create a form worthy of representing
the national idea.” The Roman is worst of
all (i. 11). A certain ideal language was indeed
employed by the poets at the Sicilian court of
Frederick and Manfred, but it was not the Sicilian
dialect (i. 12). The Tuscans speak a degraded
vernacular, although Guido Cavalcanti, Lapo
Gianni and another Florentine (Dante himself),
and Cino da Pistoia have recognised the excellence
of the ideal vulgar tongue (i. 13). Bologna alone
has a “locution tempered to a laudable suavity”;
but which, nevertheless, cannot be the ideal language,
or Guido Guinizelli and other Bolognese
poets would not have written their poems in a
form of speech quite different from the special
dialect of their city (i. 15). “The illustrious, cardinal,
courtly, and curial vulgar tongue in Italy is
that which belongs to every Italian city, and yet
seems to belong to none, and by which all the local
dialects of the Italians are measured, weighed,
and compared” (i. 16). This is that ideal Italian
which has been artistically developed by Cino
and his friend (Dante himself) in their canzoni,
and which makes its familiars so glorious
that “in the sweetness of this glory we cast our
exile behind our back” (<i>V. E.</i> i. 17). Such should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
be the language of the imperial Italian court of
justice, and, although as far as Italy is concerned
there is no prince, and that court is scattered in
body, its members are united by the gracious light
of reason (i. 18). This standard language belongs
to the whole of Italy, and is called the Italian
vernacular (<i>latinum vulgare</i>); “for this has been
used by the illustrious writers who have written
poetry in the vernacular throughout Italy, as
Sicilians, Apulians, Tuscans, natives of Romagna,
and men of both the Marches” (i. 19).</p>

<p>The examination of the dialects is perhaps the
most original feature in the book; that Dante did
not recognise that what was destined to be the
literary language of Italy was, in reality, the
Tuscan dialect, but adopted instead the theory of
a conventional or artificial Italian, was largely
due to his theories being based upon the lyrical
poetry of his predecessors, in which he seemed to
find this abstraction realised; for, though natives
of different regions of Italy, they used—or, in the
form in which their poems came to him, appeared
to have used—a common literary language.
Nevertheless in the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, which was
to codify the national language, Dante recognised
that he himself was speaking Tuscan (<i>Inf.</i> xxiii.
76, <i>Purg.</i> xvi. 137).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Book II.</span>—The unfinished second book is of the
utmost value to the student of Italian poetic form.
It makes us realise, too, how zealously Dante<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
sought out technical perfection, studying subtle
musical and rhythmical effects, curiously weighing
the divisions of his stanzas, balancing lines,
selecting words, harmonising syllables. No less
noteworthy are his modest references to his own
work and his generous appreciation of that of
others, his predecessors and contemporaries, with
reference to whose poems, as well as to his own,
he illustrates his maxims. There is a certain
limitation in that Dante conceives of poetry as
only lyrical and written to be set to music (ii. 4),
recognising only the most elaborate and least
spontaneous forms of lyrical poetry—the Canzone
(of which the Sestina is a variety), the Ballata,
the Sonnet (ii. 3). There is no hint of that splendid
rhythm, at once epical and lyrical, in which
the <i>Divina Commedia</i> was to be written; though
it is possible that Dante would have dealt with it
in the fourth book, in which he intended to treat
the discernment to be exercised with a subject fit
to be sung in the “comic” style, in which sometimes
the “middle” and sometimes the “lowly”
vernacular may be used (ii. 4), and also, dealing
with poems in the “middle” vulgar tongue, to
treat specially of rhyme (ii. 13). The third book
would perhaps have been concerned with the use
of the illustrious vernacular in Italian prose (ii. 1.)</p>

<p>The illustrious vulgar tongue having been
found, Dante proceeds thus to show the noblest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
use to which it can be put by the poet. Only three
subjects are sufficiently exalted to be sung in this
stateliest form of Italian speech, this highest
vernacular: <i>Salus</i>, <i>Venus</i>, <i>Virtus</i>; or those things
which specially relate to them: the rightful use of
arms, the fire of love, the direction of the will;
and the first of these themes had not been handled,
according to Dante, by any Italian poet. He cites
Bertran de Born as having written on arms,
Arnaut Daniel and Cino da Pistoia on love,
Giraut de Borneil and “the friend of Cino” (himself)
on <i>rectitudo</i> (ii. 2). Of the three legitimate
lyrical forms the canzone is noblest, and contains
what Rossetti called the “fundamental brainwork”
of the most illustrious poets (ii. 3). And
the ballata is nobler than the sonnet. It is in the
canzone alone, in the “tragic” or highest style,
that these sublime themes are to be sung; the
style in which the stateliness of the lines, the
loftiness of the construction, and the excellence
of the words agree with the dignity of the subject.
In this superexcellent sense, a canzone is a composition
in the loftiest style of equal stanzas, without
a refrain, referring to one subject.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
the rest of the book is occupied with rules for its
proper construction; the different lines to be used,
the choice of words, the structure of the various
types of stanza, in which the whole art of the
canzone is contained, the arrangement of rhymes;
the work breaking off at the point where Dante
was about to treat of the number of lines and
syllables in the stanza. It is noteworthy that,
though he illustrates his practical rules by examples
from the Provençal troubadours, his
Italian predecessors and contemporaries, and his
own canzoni, the great Latin poets are set up as
models: “The more closely we imitate these, the
more correctly we write poetry” (ii. 4). There
is some indication that the <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>
would have been dedicated to Cino da Pistoia as
the <i>Vita Nuova</i> had been to Guido Cavalcanti.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Date of Composition.</span>—The <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>
was probably written about the same time
as the <i>Convivio</i> or slightly earlier. From a mention
of the Marquis Giovanni of Monferrato
apparently as living (<i>V. E.</i> i. 12), who died in
January (?) 1305, it has been supposed that Book
i. cannot be much later than the beginning of that
year. Dante’s evident friendly feeling for Bologna
(which altered before he wrote the <i>Commedia</i>)
may be connected with the time when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
Florentine exiles were welcomed in that city, before
the decree of expulsion in 1306. It has sometimes
been thought that Book ii. may be a much
later piece of work, produced as a poetical textbook
at Ravenna in Dante’s last years, and broken
off, as Boccaccio suggests, by his death. Nevertheless,
when the tone of the work and the probable
dates of the lyrics quoted be taken into account,
it seems more probable that what we have
of the <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i> was written between
1304 and 1306; it represents part of the labours
which were interrupted by the advent of Henry
VII., or abandoned when the poet turned to the
<i>Divina Commedia</i>.</p>


<h3>2. <i>The “Monarchia”</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The Empire.</span>—Upon all the political life of
mediaeval Italy lay the gigantic shadow of a
stupendous edifice, the Holy Roman Empire.
Although the barbarians had struck down the
body of the Empire of Rome, the spirit of Julius
Caesar was mighty yet, as in Shakespeare’s
tragedy. The monarchy of Augustus, of Trajan,
of Constantine and Justinian, still lived; not in
the persons of the impotent Caesars of Byzantium,
but in those of the successors of Charlemagne.
From the coronation of Otto the Saxon
(962) to the death of the Suabian Frederick II.
(1250), the mediaeval western world saw in the
man whom the Germans recognised as their sovereign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
the “King of the Romans ever Augustus,”
the Emperor-elect, who when crowned at Rome
would be “Romanorum Imperator,” the supreme
head of the universal Monarchy and the Vicar of
God in things temporal, even as the Pope was the
supreme head of the universal Church and the
Vicar of God in things spiritual. In the eyes of
Dante, the Papacy and the Empire alike proceeded
from God, and were inseparably wedded to
Rome, the eternal city; from which as two suns
they should shed light upon man’s spiritual and
temporal paths, as divinely ordained by the infinite
goodness of Him from whom the power of
Peter and of Caesar bifurcates as from a point
(<i>Purg. xvi.</i> 106-108, <i>Epist.</i> v. 5).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Papal Claims.</span>—With the increase of their
temporal power, the successors of Hildebrand, in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, had extended
their authority from spiritual into purely secular
regions. For them the imperial dignity was not
of divine origin, but the gift of the Church to
Charlemagne and his German successors. “What
is the Teutonic King till consecrated at Rome?”
wrote Adrian to Frederick Barbarossa: “The
chair of Peter has given and can withdraw its
gifts.” In the interregnum that followed the fall
of the house of Suabia, the Popes had claimed to
exercise imperial rights in Italy, with disastrous
results. They had joined the sword with the
pastoral staff; and the Church, by confounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
in herself the two governments, had fallen into the
mire (<i>Purg.</i> xvi. 109-112, 127-129). And this
tendency in the Papacy culminated in the extravagant
pretensions of Boniface VIII., in his relations
with both the Empire and France, and his
famous Bull <i>Unam Sanctam</i> (November 1302),
declaring that the temporal power of kings is subject
to the spiritual power of the priesthood, and
directed by it as the body by the soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Date of the “Monarchia.”</span>—The <i>Monarchia</i> is
Dante’s attempt to solve this burning mediaeval
question of the proper relations of Church and
State, of spiritual and temporal authority. Although
it is undoubtedly the most famous of his
prose works, the most widely divergent views have
been held as to its date of composition. If the
<i>Vita Nuova</i> is the most ideal book of love, the
<i>Monarchia</i> is one of the most purely idealistic
works ever written on politics. Even as Beatrice
is the most glorious lady of the poet’s mind, <i>la
gloriosa donna de la mia mente</i>, so the temporal
monarchy or Empire is to be considered by the
poet in its ideal aspect according to the divine
intention, <i>typo et secundum intentionem</i> (<i>Mon.</i>
i. 2). Like the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, and unlike any other
of Dante’s longer works, the <i>Monarchia</i> contains
no mention of the poet’s exile, and no explicit
references or allusions to contemporary events
or persons. From this, and other considerations,
it has sometimes been held that the <i>Monarchia</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
was written during his political life in Florence.
Boccaccio, on the other hand, declares that Dante
made this book on the coming of Henry VII., and
the trend of criticism to-day is to accept 1313 as
the approximate date. There are, however, scholars
who consider it more probable that the <i>Monarchia</i>
was written towards the close of the poet’s
life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Book I.</span>—The <i>Monarchia</i> is divided into three
books, corresponding to the three questions to be
answered touching this most useful and least
explored amongst occult and useful truths, the
knowledge of the temporal monarchy (i. 1). In
its ideal sense, the temporal Monarchy, or Empire,
is defined as “a unique princedom extending over
all persons in time, or in and over those things
which are measured by time” (i. 2). And the
first question arising concerning this temporal
Monarchy is—whether it is necessary for the
well-being of the world.</p>

<p>The proper function of the human race taken as
a whole, the ultimate end or goal, for which the
eternal God by His art, which is nature, brings
into being the human race in its universality, is
constantly to actualise or bring into play the whole
capacity of the possible intellect, for contemplation
and for action, for speculation and for operation
(i. 3). And, for this almost divine function
and goal, the most direct means is universal peace
(i. 4). Since it is ordained for this goal, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
human race must be guided by one ruling power,
the Emperor, with reference to whom all its parts
have their order; in subjection to whom, the human
race becomes in its unity most like to God
(i. 5-9). There must be some one supreme judge
to decide by his judgment, mediately or immediately,
all contentions; and such a judge can only
be the Monarch (i. 10).</p>

<p>Again, the world is best disposed when justice
is paramount therein; but this can only be under
the Monarch or Emperor, who alone, free from
covetousness and supreme in authority, will have
the purest will and the greatest power to practise
justice upon the earth (i. 11). Under him the
human race will be most free, since it will have
the fullest use of freewill, the greatest gift of God
to man (i. 12). He alone, adorned with judgment
and justice in the highest degree, will be best disposed
for ruling, and able to dispose others best
(i. 13). From him the particular princes receive
the common rule by which the human race is
guided to peace; his is the dominating will that
rules the wills of mortals, disposing them to unity
and concord (i. 14, 15). All these and other reasons
show that, for the well-being of the world,
it is necessary that there should be the Monarchy.
And they are confirmed by the sacred fact that
Christ willed to become man in the “fullness of
time,” when the world was blessed with universal
peace under the perfect monarchy of Augustus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
the seamless garment that has since been rent by
the nail of cupidity (i. 16).</p>

<p>To the modern mind the first book of the <i>Monarchia</i>
is the most important. The conception that
the goal of civilisation is the realising of all human
potentialities is one of abiding significance. Divested
of its mediaeval garb, the Empire itself
becomes a permanent court of international justice,
a supreme and impartial tribunal of international
arbitration. Within such a restored
unity of civilisation, nations and kingdoms and
cities will develop freely and peacefully, in accordance
with their own conditions and laws (<i>cf.</i>
i. 10, 12, 14, and <i>Conv.</i> iv. 4). Here Dante anticipates
what Mazzini called the “United States of
Europe,” or, more broadly, “Humanity.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Book II.</span>—The second book answers the question
whether the Roman people took to itself this
dignity of Monarchy, or Empire, by right. But
right in things is nothing else than the similitude
of the Divine Will, and what God wills in human
society is to be held as true and pure right. God’s
will is invisible; but it is manifested in this matter
by the whole history of Rome (ii. 1, 2). The surpassing
nobleness of Aeneas, and therefore of his
descendants (ii. 3); the traditional miracles
wrought for the Romans (ii. 4); the devotion of
the great Roman citizens from Cincinnatus to
Cato, showing that the Roman people, in subjecting
the world to itself, contemplated the good of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
the Commonwealth, and therefore the end of right
(ii. 5, 6); the manifest adaptation of the Roman
people by nature for ruling the nations with imperial
sway (ii. 7);—all these prove that it was
by right that the Romans acquired the Empire.
The hidden judgment of God is sometimes revealed
by contest, whether in the clash of champions
in an ordeal or in the contention of rivals
striving together for some prize (ii. 8). Such a
prize was the empire of the world, which by divine
judgment fell to the Roman people, when all were
wrestling for it, and the kings of the Assyrians,
Egyptians, and Persians, and even Alexander
himself had failed (ii. 9). Their wars, too, from
the earliest times were under the form of an
ordeal; and Divine Providence declared in their
favour. Thus arguments resting on principles of
reason prove that the Roman people acquired the
supreme and universal jurisdiction by right (ii.
10, 11). And arguments based upon principles of
Christian faith support it. Christ, by His birth
under the edict of Augustus, confirmed the imperial
jurisdiction from which that edict proceeded;
and, by His death under the vicar of
Tiberius, He confirmed the universal penal jurisdiction
of the Emperor over all the human race
which was to be punished in His flesh (ii. 12, 13).
“Let them cease to reproach the Roman Empire,
who feign themselves to be sons of the Church;
when they see that the Bridegroom, Christ, thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
confirmed it at either limit of His warfare” (<i>i.e.</i>
at the beginning and at the end of His life upon
earth).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Book III.</span>—And this rebuke to the clergy, from
whom the main opposition to the Empire proceeded,
naturally leads to the great question of the
third book, the pith of the whole treatise.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Does
the authority of the Roman Monarch or Emperor,
who is thus by right the monarch of the world,
depend immediately upon God, or upon some vicar
of God, the successor of Peter? (iii. 1, 2, 3). The
stock arguments of those who assert from passages
of Scripture, such as the creation of the sun
and moon, or the two swords mentioned in St.
Luke’s Gospel, that the authority of the Empire
depends upon that of the Church, are readily
brushed away (iii. 4-9). And, as for their historical
evidence, the donation of Constantine, if
genuine, was invalid; the coronation of Charlemagne
was an act of usurpation (iii. 10, 11). The
authority of the Church cannot be the cause of
the imperial authority, since the latter was efficient,
and was confirmed by Christ, before the
Church existed (iii. 13). Neither has the Church
this power of authorising the Emperor from God,
nor from herself, nor from any Emperor, nor from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
the consent of the majority of mankind; indeed,
such power is absolutely contrary to her very
nature and the words of her Divine Founder (iii.
14, 15).</p>

<p>But it may be directly shown that the authority
of the Emperor depends immediately upon God.
For man, since he alone partakes of corruptibility
and incorruptibility, is ordained for two ultimate
ends—blessedness of this life, which is figured in
the Earthly Paradise, and blessedness of life
eternal, which consists in the fruition of the Divine
Aspect in the Celestial Paradise.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> To these two
beatitudes, as to diverse ends, man must come by
diverse means. For to the first we come by philosophic
teachings, provided that we follow them by
acting in accordance with the moral and intellectual
virtues; to the second by spiritual teachings,
transcending human reason, as we follow them by
acting in accordance with the theological virtues,
Faith, Hope, Charity. But in spite of reason and
revelation, which make these ends and means
known to us, human cupidity would reject them,
“were not men, like horses going astray in their
brutishness, held in the way by bit and rein.”
“Wherefore man had need of a twofold directive
power according to his twofold end, to wit, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
supreme Pontiff, to lead the human race, in accordance
with things revealed, to eternal life; and
the Emperor, to direct the human race to temporal
felicity in accordance with the teachings of
philosophy.” It is the special function of the
Emperor to establish liberty and peace upon
earth, to make the world correspond to the
divinely ordained disposition of the heavens.
Therefore he is chosen and confirmed by God
alone; the so-called Electors are only the proclaimers
(<i>denuntiatores</i>) of Divine Providence.
“Thus, then, it is plain that the authority of the
temporal monarch descends upon him without any
mean from the fountain of universal authority.”
Yet it must not be taken that the Roman Prince
is not subordinate in anything to the Roman
Pontiff, since this mortal felicity is in some sort
ordained with reference to immortal felicity.
“Let Caesar, therefore, observe that reverence to
Peter which a firstborn son should observe to a
father, so that, illuminated by the light of paternal
grace, he may with greater power irradiate the
world, over which he is set by Him alone who is
ruler of all things spiritual and temporal” (<i>Mon.</i>
iii. 16).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reception of the Work.</span>—The <i>Monarchia</i> remained
almost unknown until the great conflict
between Louis of Bavaria and Pope John XXII.,
after Dante’s death. Boccaccio tells us that the
Imperialists used arguments from the book in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
support of their claims, and it became in consequence
very famous. A tempest of clerical indignation
roared round it. A Dominican friar,
Guido Vernani, wrote a virulent but occasionally
acute treatise, “on the power of the Supreme
Pontiff and in confutation of the <i>Monarchy</i> composed
by Dante Alighieri,” which he dedicated
as a warning to Ser Graziolo de’ Bambaglioli,
chancellor of Bologna, Dante’s commentator and
apologist. The notorious Cardinal Bertrando del
Poggetto, who had been sent as papal legate to
Italy by John XXII., had the <i>Monarchia</i> burnt
as heretical, and followed this up—apparently in
1329—by an infamous attempt to desecrate Dante’s
tomb. In the sixteenth century it was placed
upon the Index of Prohibited Books. Dante had
anticipated this, and the splendid passage which
opens the third book of the <i>Monarchia</i> strikes the
keynote, not only of this treatise, but of all his life-work
for what he conceived the service of God and
the welfare of man:</p>

<p>“Since the truth about it cannot be laid bare
without putting certain to the blush, perchance it
will be the cause of some indignation against me.
But since Truth from her immutable throne demands
it, and Solomon, too, as he enters the forest
of the Proverbs, teaches us by his own example
to meditate upon the truth and abjure the impious
man, and the Philosopher, teacher of morals, urges
us to sacrifice friendship for truth, therefore I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
take courage from the words of Daniel, wherein
the divine power, the shield of such as defend the
truth, is proffered; and, putting on the breastplate
of faith, according to the admonition of
Paul, in the warmth of that coal which one of the
Seraphim took from the celestial altar and touched
the lips of Isaiah withal, I will enter upon the
present wrestling-ground, and, by the arm of Him
who delivered us from the power of darkness by
His blood, will I hurl the impious and the liar out
of the ring in the sight of all the world. What
should I fear, since the Spirit, coeternal with the
Father and with the Son, says by the mouth of
David: ‘The just shall be had in everlasting
remembrance; he shall not be afraid of an evil
report’?”</p>


<h3>3. <i>The “Epistolae”</i></h3>

<p>Dante tells us in the <i>Vita Nuova</i> that, on the
death of Beatrice, he wrote a Latin letter to the
chief persons of the city, concerning its desolate
and widowed condition, beginning with the text
of Jeremiah: “How doth the city sit solitary.”
Neither this nor the letter mentioned by Leonardo
Bruni, in which Dante described the fight at Campaldino,
has survived. Many epistles ascribed to
Dante were extant in the days of Boccaccio and
Bruni. Bruni tells us that, after the affair at
Lastra, Dante wrote for permission to return to
Florence both to individual citizens in the government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
and to the people, especially a long letter
beginning: “O my people, what have I done unto
thee?” This may perhaps have been the letter
which Bruni records, in which the poet defends
his impartiality when the leaders of the two factions
were banished; but there appears to have
been another, denying that he had accompanied
the Emperor against Florence. From one of
these the perplexing fragment may have come,
about his want of prudence in the priorate and
his service at Campaldino. Giovanni Villani
mentions three noble epistles, the style of which
he praises highly: one to the government of
Florence, “complaining of his unjust exile,”
which is probably the lost letter mentioned by
Bruni; the second, to the Emperor Henry, and
the third, to the Italian cardinals, have both been
preserved. Flavio Biondo, in the fifteenth century,
professes to have seen letters at Forlì dictated
by Dante, notably one addressed by the poet,
in his own name and on behalf of the exiled Bianchi,
to Can Grande della Scala concerning the
reply of the Florentines to the ambassadors of
the Emperor.</p>

<p>There are now thirteen extant Latin letters
ascribed to Dante. They have come down to us
mainly in two fourteenth-century manuscripts;
three have been preserved in Boccaccio’s handwriting
in the Laurentian MS., known as the
<i>Zibaldone Boccaccesco</i>; nine others in a Vatican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
MS., of which Boccaccio was perhaps the original
compiler. Two of these latter have also been
found in another MS. of the fourteenth century—the
San Pantaleo MS. at Rome. No MS. of the
letter to Can Grande is known earlier than the
fifteenth century.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Epistles I. and II.</span>—Epistles i. and ii. are connected
with Count Alessandro da Romena, who,
Bruni states, was appointed captain of the Bianchi
in their meeting at Gargonza, and whom Dante
brands with infamy in <i>Inferno</i> xxx. The former
is addressed in the name of Alessandro, the council
and whole body of the White party, to the
Cardinal Niccolò da Prato, legate of Benedict XI.,
assuring him of their gratitude and confidence,
promising to refrain from hostilities in expectation
of his good offices in the pacification of Florence.
It may be accepted as an authentic document
of 1304; but whether it was written by Dante,
who had perhaps already left his fellow-exiles, is
still open to question. The second is a letter of
condolence to Alessandro’s nephews, Oberto and
Guido, on the occasion of their uncle’s death,
which probably occurred in the same year. Its
authenticity is highly doubtful. Both letters are
found only in the Vatican manuscript.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Epistles III. and IV.</span>—Epistles iii. and iv. are
directly connected with the <i>Rime</i>. The third,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
which occurs in the Boccaccian autograph, seems
to be to Cino da Pistoia, affectionate greetings
from the Florentine exile to the Pistoian, explaining
how one passion may be replaced by another
in the soul. It was accompanied by a poem, which
is identified with the sonnet, “Io sono stato con
Amore insieme.” If authentic, its date would
be not later than 1306, when Cino’s exile ended.
The fourth letter, found in the Vatican MS., is
addressed to the Marquis Moroello Malaspina,
apparently from the Casentino, and describes in
forcible language how the writer was suddenly
enamoured of a woman’s beauty. It, too, was
accompanied by a poem, evidently the canzone,
“Amor, da che convien pur ch’io mi doglia.” The
more probable date is 1307 or thereabouts.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The
authenticity of these two letters is doubtful, but
on the whole probable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Epistles V., VI. and VII.</span>—Next come the three
great political letters, glorified pamphlets on the
enterprise of Henry of Luxemburg. Letter v.,
the manifesto to the Princes and Peoples of Italy,
seems to have been written in September or October,
1310, before Henry crossed the Alps. It
announces the advent of Henry, the bridegroom
and glory of Italy, as bringing a new era of peace,
declares the rightful authority and historical
sanctity of the Empire, exhorting the peoples to
free and joyous submission, and those who, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
the writer himself, have suffered injustice to be
merciful in their anticipated triumph. The letter,
one of the noblest of Dante’s utterances, is a landmark
in the growth of the national idea in Italy;
rulers and peoples are admonished as members of
one body; the good tidings are announced to the
nation as a whole; the writer’s Italian citizenship
is placed before his Florentine origin, when he
subscribes himself: “The humble Italian, Dante
Alighieri, a Florentine unjustly exiled.” It was
in the bitter indignation caused by the Guelf opposition,
the alliance between Florence and King
Robert, and the doubt occasioned by the Emperor’s
own delay in Lombardy, that Dante from
the Casentino wrote the terrible Letters vi. and
vii., on March 31st, 1311, to the Florentines, “the
most wicked Florentines within,” and on April
17th to Henry himself, “the most sacred triumphant
and only lord.” The former denounces the
Florentines for their rebellion, their “shrinking
from the yoke of liberty,” their attempt to make
their civic life independent of that of Rome, and,
in prophetic fashion, warns them of their coming
destruction at the hands of “the prince who is the
giver of the law.” In the latter, adopting the
part of Curio towards Caesar (which he himself
condemns in the <i>Inferno</i>), Dante urges the Emperor
without further delay to turn his forces
upon Florence, who “sharpens the horns of rebellion
against Rome which made her in her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
image and after her likeness.” The poet’s attitude
is that of the Hebrew prophets; his motive,
the conviction that his native city had adopted a
line of policy opposed to the true interests of Italy.
These three letters are contained in the Vatican
MS.; Letters v. and vii. (of both of which early
Italian translations are extant) also in the S. Pantaleo
MS., and there is a third (fifteenth century)
MS. of the letter to the Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Epistles VII.*, VII.** and VII.***.</span>—These
three letters are a humble pendant to the three
just considered. They are addressed to Margaret
of Brabant, the wife of the Emperor Henry, in
the name of the Countess of Battifolle (Gherardesca,
daughter of Count Ugolino, married to
Guido di Simone of the Conti Guidi). They are
in answer to letters from the Empress, and, while
containing mere expressions of loyal devotion and
aspirations for the triumph of the imperial cause,
their place in the Vatican MS. among the letters
of Dante, together with the close resemblance in
style and phraseology with the latter, has led to a
general acceptance of the view that they were
written by the poet. They were written in the
spring of 1311, the third being dated from Poppi
on May 18th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Epistle VIII.</span>—The letter to the Italian Cardinals,
which is mentioned by Villani, and echoed by
Petrarch in his canzone on Rome (“Spirto gentil
che quelle membra reggi”), is found only in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
Boccaccio’s autograph manuscript. It was written
shortly after the death of Clement V. (April
20, 1314), when the cardinals were assembled in
conclave at Carpentras; lamenting the desolation
of the sacred city, it exhorts them, “for the bride
of Christ, for the seat of the bride, which is Rome,
for our Italy, and, to speak more fully, for the
whole estate of those on pilgrimage on earth,”
to restore the Apostolic See to its consecrated
place. It is a noble protest of a devout and
learned layman against a corrupt and ignorant
clergy, of a Catholic and an Italian patriot against
the papal desertion of Rome, in which Dante
stands forth as the new Jeremiah, renewing for
the sacred city of Christendom the lamentation of
his Hebrew predecessor for Jerusalem. The letter
presents striking analogies with the canto of
the simonist popes (<i>Inf.</i> xix.), but is more moderate
in tone, as the poet is here less denouncing
than attempting to convert the cardinals to his
point of view. There is extant a letter to the
French King from Cardinal Napoleone Orsini
(whom Dante admonishes by name in the epistle)
with passages of a somewhat similar kind; it is
tempting to suppose that the cardinal had actually
received the exhortation and caught fire from
the burning words of his fellow Italian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Epistle IX.</span>—The occasion of the letter refusing
the amnesty has been already considered
(chap. i.). It was probably written in the latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
part of May 1315. In the Boccaccian autograph
(in which alone it is found) it has no title; the
traditional <i>Amico florentino</i>, “to a Florentine
friend,” is a later addition. It is practically the
only example of the poet’s personal correspondence
that has been preserved. Barbi has thrown
grave doubts upon the identification of the person
to whom the letter is addressed with Teruccio di
Manetto Donati, the brother of Dante’s wife; the
nephew mentioned may perhaps be Andrea Poggi
(<i>cf.</i> chap. i.) or, more probably, Niccolò Donati,
the son of Gemma’s brother Foresino. It is here
that Dante calls himself the preacher of justice,
<i>vir praedicans iustitiam</i>, a claim which is the key
of the <i>Commedia</i> and may be traced from the canzone
of the “Tre donne.” Nor is it without significance
that the closing words of the letter, <i>nec
panis deficiet</i>, “nor will bread fail me,” echo the
same chapter of Isaiah (li. 14) which inspired the
canzone in which Dante holds his exile as an
honour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Epistle X.</span>—The Epistle to Can Grande stands
apart from the others. Although eight MSS. are
now known, none are earlier than the fifteenth
century, and the two earliest contain no more than
the opening sections. Some of the early commentators—Pietro
Alighieri, Fra Guido da Pisa, and
Boccaccio—were evidently acquainted with it; it
was first expressly quoted by Filippo Villani in
1391, and published first in 1700, before any of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
Dante’s letters had seen the light, excepting the
unsatisfactory Italian version of the Epistle to
Henry of Luxemburg. If genuine, and its authenticity
though much disputed seems now almost
certain, it was probably written in 1318 or early
in 1319, apparently before the first Eclogue.</p>

<p>Beginning with language of enthusiastic praise
and grateful friendship, which recalls analogous
passages in Canto xvii., the poet prepares to pay
back the benefits he has received with the dedication
of the <i>Paradiso</i>. So far (1-4), the epistolary
form has been maintained, and this is the only portion
of the letter found in the earlier MSS.; but
now the writer assumes the office of a lecturer,
and, with a quotation from the <i>Metaphysics</i> of
Aristotle, proceeds to give an introduction to the
<i>Commedia</i> and a commentary upon the first canto
of the third cantica. He distinguishes the literal
and allegorical meanings, defines the title of the
whole (“The Comedy of Dante Alighieri, Florentine
by birth, not by character”) and of the part,
and explains the difference between comedy and
tragedy from a somewhat different point of view
from that of the <i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i> (ii. 4).
The subject of the <i>Paradiso</i>, in the literal sense, is
the state of the blessed after death; in the allegorical
sense, man according as by meriting he is
subject to Justice rewarding. “The end of the
whole and of the part is to remove those living in
this life from the state of misery, and to lead them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
to the state of felicity” (<i>Epist.</i> x. 15). Dante emphasises
the ethical aspect of the poem: “The
whole as well as the part was conceived, not for
speculation, but with a practical object” (x. 16).
Then follows a minute scholastic and mystical interpretation
of the opening lines of the first canto
of the <i>Paradiso</i> in the literal sense, closing in an
eloquent and very beautiful summary of the ascent
through the spheres of Paradise to find true beatitude
in the vision of the Divine Essence. Throughout
this part of the letter Dante, when touching
upon the details of his vision, always speaks of
himself in the third person, evidently following
the example of St. Paul in the Second Epistle to
the Corinthians. He unmistakably implies that he
has actually been the recipient of some personal
spiritual experience, which he is unable adequately
to relate. That passionate self-reproach,
which sounds in so many passages of the <i>Divina
Commedia</i>, makes itself heard here too. If the
invidious do not believe in the power of the human
intellect so to transcend the measure of humanity,
let them read the examples cited from Scripture
and the mystical treatises of Richard of St. Victor,
Bernard, Augustine. But, if the unworthiness of
the speaker makes them question such an elevation,
let them see in Daniel how Nebuchodonosor
by divine inspiration had a vision against sinners:
“For He who ‘maketh His sun to rise on the evil
and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
on the unjust,’ sometimes in mercy for their conversion,
sometimes in wrath for their punishment,
reveals His glory, in greater or less measure, as
He wills, to those who live never so evily” (<i>Epist.</i>
x. 28). This section of the letter, for the student
of mystical experience, is of the highest significance.</p>


<h3>4. <i>The “Eclogae”</i></h3>

<p>Belonging, like the tenth Epistle, to that closing
period of Dante’s life when he was engaged on
the <i>Paradiso</i>, are two delightful pastoral poems
in Latin hexameters. Here, too, we owe much to
the piety of Boccaccio. The earliest and most
authoritative of the five manuscripts is again in
his handwriting, in the <i>Zibaldone Boccaccesco</i>
(where the poems are accompanied by explanatory
notes), in the Laurentian Library.</p>

<p>Giovanni del Virgilio, a young lecturer and a
poet, had written to Dante from Bologna a letter
in Latin verse, expressing his profound admiration
for the singer of the Commedia, but respectfully
remonstrating with him for writing in
Italian, and suggesting some stirring contemporary
subjects as worthy matters for his muse:
the death of Henry VII., the battle of Montecatini,
a victory of Can Grande over the Paduans, the
struggle by sea and land between King Robert of
Naples and the Visconti for the possession of
Genoa. The reference to this last event shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
that the letter cannot have been written before
July 1318, while a passage towards the close
clearly indicates the early part of the following
year. It further contains a pressing invitation to
come and take the laurel crown at Bologna, or,
at least, to answer the letter, “if it vex thee not,
to have read first the feeble numbers which the
rash goose cackles to the clear-voiced swan.”</p>

<p>Dante’s first Eclogue is the answer. Adopting
the pastoral style, he himself and his companion
Dino Perini (whom Boccaccio afterwards knew)
appear as shepherds, Tityrus and Meliboeus, discussing
the invitation from Mopsus. It was probably
written in the spring or early summer of
1319. In a medley of generous praise and kindly
banter, Dante declines to visit Bologna, “that
knows not the gods,” and still hopes to receive the
poet’s crown at Florence. When the <i>Paradiso</i> is
finished, then will it be time to think of ivy and
laurel; and in the meanwhile, to convert Mopsus
from his errors with respect to vernacular poetry,
he will send him ten measures of milk fresh from
the best-loved ewe of all his flock—ten cantos from
the <i>Paradiso</i>, which evidently are not yet published,
since the sheep is yet unmilked.</p>

<p>Mopsus in his answer expresses the intense
admiration with which he and his fellow Arcadians
have heard this song, and adopts the same style.
Condoling with Dante on his unjust exile, he foresees
his return home and reunion with Phyllis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
who may perhaps be Gemma or (as Carducci suggested)
an impersonification of Florence. But, in
the meanwhile, pastoral pleasures and an enthusiastic
welcome await him at Bologna, if Iolas
(Guido da Polenta) will let him go. A reference
to “Phrygian Muso” enables us to fix approximately
the date; towards the beginning of September,
1319, Albertino Mussato, the Paduan poet
and patriot, was at Bologna, endeavouring to get
aid from the Guelf communes for his native city
against Can Grande. Dante could hardly have
with consistency accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>The writer of the notes on the Laurentian
manuscript, whether Boccaccio himself or another,
commenting upon a poem sent by Giovanni
del Virgilio to Albertino Mussato, states that
Dante delayed a year before answering this
Eclogue, and that his reply was forwarded after
his death by his son. His second Eclogue is in
narrative form, and professes to be no more than
the report by the writer of a conversation between
Dante and his friends which is overheard by Guido
da Polenta. A new associate of the poet’s last
days is introduced to us: the shepherd Alphesiboeus,
who is identified with Fiducio de’ Milotti
of Certaldo, a distinguished physician resident at
Ravenna. The tone is the same as that of the
other Eclogue. Ravenna becomes the pastures of
Pelorus, while Bologna is the Cyclops’ cave, to
which Dante still refuses to go, for fear of Polyphemus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
whose atrocities in the past are recorded.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
And the crown expected now is, perhaps, no longer
one which any earthly city can give: “For this
illustrious head already the Pruner is hastening
to award an everlasting garland.”</p>

<p>These two Eclogues are of priceless value. Nowhere
else is such a comparatively bright picture
of Dante’s closing days given us. The genuine
and hearty laughter which greets Giovanni’s two
letters, the generous tone of the supreme singer
towards the young scholar poet, the kindly joking
at the expense of Dino, make delightful reading
and show us quite another side of Dante’s character.
Giovanni’s first letter implies that the
earlier parts of the <i>Commedia</i> had not only been
published, but had acquired a certain popularity.
From Dante’s first Eclogue it follows that, by 1319,
both <i>Inferno</i> and <i>Purgatorio</i> were completed, and
that the <i>Paradiso</i> was in preparation: “When the
bodies that flow round the world, and they that
dwell among the stars, shall be shown forth in my
song, even as the lower realms, then shall I delight
to crown my head with ivy and with laurel.” And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
after this the passage in the second Eclogue, written
apparently in 1321, however we interpret it,
has the same pathos and sanctity as Petrarch’s
note on the last line of his <i>Triumph of Eternity</i>,
or the abrupt ending of Shelley’s <i>Triumph of
Life</i>:</p>

<h3>5. <i>The “Quaestio de Aqua et Terra”</i></h3>

<p>The <i>Quaestio de Aqua et Terra</i>—which purports
to be a discourse or lecture delivered by
Dante in the church of Sant’ Elena at Verona on
January 20th, 1320—was first published in 1508 by
an Augustinian friar, Giovan Benedetto Moncetti.
No manuscript of it is known to exist, and there
is no reference to the work or to the event in any
earlier writer, though Antonio Pucci (after the
middle of the fourteenth century) implies that
Dante sought disputations of this kind. In this
work the poet—in accordance with the physical
science of his age—discusses the question of the
relative position of the element earth and the element
water upon the surface of the globe. The
<i>Quaestio</i> was until recently regarded as a fabrication
of the early sixteenth century, but Moore in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
England and Vincenzo Biagi in Italy, mainly on
the internal evidence of the work itself, have convinced
many Dante scholars that it may be regarded
with some probability as authentic.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>THE “DIVINA COMMEDIA”</h2>
</div>



<h3>1. <i>Introductory</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Letter and Allegory.</span>—The <i>Divina Commedia</i> is
a vision and an allegory. It is a vision of the
world beyond the grave; it is an allegory, based
upon that vision, of the life and destiny of man,
his need of light and guidance, his duties to the
temporal and spiritual powers, to the Empire and
the Church. In the literal sense, the subject is the
state of souls after death. In the allegorical sense,
according to the Epistle to Can Grande, the subject
is “man as by freedom of will, meriting and
demeriting, he is subject to Justice rewarding or
punishing” (<i>Epist.</i> x. 11). There is, therefore,
the distinction between the essential Hell, Purgatory,
Paradise of separated spirits—the lost and
the redeemed—after death; and the moral or
spiritual Hell, Purgatory, Paradise, of men still
united to their bodies in this life, using their free
will for good or for evil; sinning, doing penance,
living virtuously. The <i>Inferno</i> represents the
state of ignorance and vice; the <i>Purgatorio</i> is the
life of converted sinners, obeying Caesar and reconciled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
to Peter, doing penance and striving God-wards;
after the state of felicity has been regained
in the Earthly Paradise, the <i>Paradiso</i> represents
the ideal life of action and contemplation, closing
in an anticipation, here and now, of the Beatific
Vision. The whole poem is the mystical epic of
the freedom of man’s will in time and in eternity,
the soul after conversion passing through the
stages of purification and illumination to the attainment
of union and fruition.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the allegorical interpretation
of the <i>Commedia</i> has frequently been
carried to excess. This has led to a reaction, represented
now by Benedetto Croce, who would
separate the allegorical and didactic elements
from the poetry, in which alone the true value of
the work consists. Such a tendency in its turn, if
pressed too far, derogates from Dante’s greatness
and mars the unity of the poem. In Dante the
poet and the practical man—teacher, prophet,
politician, philosopher, reformer—are inseparable;
more often purely doctrinal themes become
so fused in his imagination, so identified with his
personality, that the result is lyrical and great
poetry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Title.</span>—Dante unquestionably called his work
simply <i>Commedia</i>, which he wrote <i>Comedia</i> and
pronounced <i>Comedìa</i> (<i>Inf.</i> xvi. 128, xxi. 2). The
epithet <i>divina</i> first appears in the sixteenth-century
editions; but it would be almost as pedantic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
to discard it now as it would be, except when
reading the word where it occurs in the poem, to
return to the original pronunciation, <i>comedìa</i>.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Metrical Structure.</span>—Each of the three parts,
or cantiche, is divided into cantos: the <i>Inferno</i> into
thirty-four, the <i>Purgatorio</i> into thirty-three, the
<i>Paradiso</i> into thirty-three—thus making up a hundred
cantos, the square of the perfect number.
Each canto is composed of from one hundred and
fifteen to one hundred and sixty lines, forming
thirty-eight to fifty-three terzine, a continuous
measure of three hendecasyllabic lines, woven together
by the rhymes of the middle lines, with an
extra line rhyming with the second line of the
last terzina to close the canto:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">ABA, BCB, CDC, DED ... XYX, YZY, Z.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">The normal hendecasyllabic line is the <i>endecasillabo
piano</i>, in which the rhyme has the accent
upon the penultimate syllable (<i>rima piana</i>, trochaic
ending). Occasionally, but rarely, we find
the <i>endecasillabo sdrucciolo</i>, with the rhyme accentuated
on the antepenultimate syllable (<i>rima
sdrucciola</i>, dactylic ending), or the <i>endecasillabo
tronco</i>, with the accent on the final syllable (<i>rima
tronca</i>). Italian prosody regards both these latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
forms (which appear to have twelve and ten syllables
respectively) as lines of eleven syllables.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The <i>terza rima</i> seems to be derived from the
<i>serventese incatenato</i> (“linked serventese”), one
of the rather numerous forms of the Italian <i>serventese</i>
or <i>sermontese</i>, a species of poem introduced
from Provence in the first half of the thirteenth
century. The Provençal <i>sirventes</i> was a
serviceable composition employed mainly for
satirical, political, and ethical purposes, in contrast
with the more stately and “tragical” canzone
of love. Although the Italians extended its
range of subject and developed its metres, no one
before Dante had used it for a great poem or had
transfigured it into this superb new measure, at
once lyrical and epical. In his hand, indeed, “the
thing became a trumpet,” sounding from earth to
heaven, to call the dead to judgment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sources.</span>—The earlier mediaeval visions of the
spirit world, of which the most famous are Irish
in origin, bear the same relation, in a much
slighter degree, to the spiritual content of the
<i>Commedia</i> as the Provençal <i>sirventes</i> does to its
metrical form. Even if Dante was acquainted
with them (and there are episodes occasionally in
the poem which recall the vision of Tundal or
Tnuthgal), he was absolutely justified in asserting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
in <i>Purgatorio</i> xvi., that God willed that he
should see His court “by method wholly out of
modern use”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Per modo tutto fuor del moderno uso.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">Such ideas, even in special details, were common
property. Dante transformed the mediaeval vision
of the world beyond the grave into a supreme
work of art, making it the receptacle for all that
was noblest in the thought and aspiration of the
centuries down to his own day. If a hint or two
came from <i>Ibernia fabulosa</i>, as Ariosto calls Ireland,
the main suggestion was Roman; and Virgil
was his imperial master in very fact, as he was his
guide by poetical fiction (<i>Inf.</i> i. 82-87): “O honour
and light of the other poets, may the long study
avail me, and the great love, that has made me
search thy volume. Thou art my master and my
author; thou alone art he from whom I took the
fair style that hath gained me honour.”</p>

<p>The influence of Virgil pervades the whole
poem, and next to his comes that of Lucan. Ovid
was mainly a source of classical mythology (frequently
spiritualised in Dante’s hands); the contribution
of Horace, Statius, and Juvenal is
slighter. And Dante was as familiar with the
Bible as with the <i>Aeneid</i> and the <i>Pharsalia</i>; indeed,
one of the most salient characteristics of the
<i>Commedia</i> is the writer’s adaptation of the message
of the Hebrew prophets to his own times in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
the language and with the consummate art of the
Latin poets. In its degree, the influence of
Boëthius is as penetrating as that of Virgil; Orosius
has contributed as much history as has Livy.
The philosophy of the poem is naturally coloured
by Aristotle, studied in the Latin translations as
interpreted by Albertus Magnus and Aquinas.
Augustine and Aquinas (more generally the latter)
are the poet’s chief theological sources; his
mysticism has derived something from Richard of
St. Victor and Bonaventura as well as from Dionysius.
But he deals with his matter with independence,
as a poet, in the light of his own
spiritual experience, his own imaginative interpretation
of life and history, his own observation
of nature. Though versed in a super-eminent degree
with most of the knowledge, sacred and profane,
possible to a man of his epoch, and well-read
to an almost incredible extent when the circumstances
of his life are considered, Dante’s main
and direct source of inspiration lay, not in books,
but in that wonderful world of the closing Middle
Ages that lay open to his gaze, as from a celestial
watch-tower of contemplation: “The little space
of earth that maketh us so fierce, as I turned me
with the eternal Twins, all appeared to me from
the hills to the sea” (<i>Par.</i> xxii. 151-153).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Virgil and Beatrice.</span>—The end of the poem, as
the Epistle to Can Grande shows, is to remove
those living in this life from the state of misery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
and lead them to the state of felicity. In the individual,
this will be accomplished by opening his
eyes to the nature of vice; by inducing him to contrition,
confession, satisfaction; by leading him
to contemplation of eternal Truth. In the universality,
it can only be effected by the restoration of
the Empire and the purification of the Church.
The dual scheme of the <i>Monarchia</i> reappears in
the <i>Commedia</i>, but transferred from the sphere of
Church and State to the field of the individual soul.
In the allegorical sense, Virgil may be taken to
represent Human Philosophy based on Reason;
Beatrice to symbolize Divine Philosophy, which
includes the sacred science of Theology, and is in
possession of Revelation. But, primarily, Virgil
and Beatrice (like the other souls in the poem) are
living personalities, not allegorical types. Allegory
may be forgotten in the tender relation between
Dante and Virgil, and, when that “sweetest
father” leaves his disciple in the Earthly Paradise
to return to his own sad place in Limbo, there is
little of it left in Beatrice’s rebuke of her lover’s
past disloyalty; none when she is last seen enshrined
in glory beneath the Blessed Virgin’s
throne.</p>

<p>There is then a universal and a personal meaning
to be distinguished, as well as the literal and allegorical
significations. The <i>Divina Commedia</i> is
the tribute of devotion from one poet to another;
it is the sequel to a real love, the glorification of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
the image of a woman loved in youth; the story of
one man’s conversion and spiritual experience.
Nor can we doubt that the study of the imperial
poet of <i>alma Roma</i> helped Dante to his great political
conception of the destiny of the Empire,
even as Philosophy first lifted him from the moral
aberrations that severed him from the ideal life
(<i>Purg.</i> xxiii. 118). But, at the same time, Dante
represents all mankind; as Witte remarks, “the
poet stands as the type of the whole race of fallen
man, called to salvation.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dates and Epoch.</span>—Although the vision is poetically
placed in the spring of 1300, during the
Pope’s jubilee and shortly before Dante’s election
to the priorate, the actual date of composition of
the poem—as far as concerns the first two parts—is
still uncertain and disputed. There are at
present two principal theories. According to the
one (very strongly held by Parodi), the <i>Inferno</i>
was composed shortly before the advent of Henry
of Luxemburg, the <i>Purgatorio</i> during his Italian
enterprise. According to the other, not only the
<i>Paradiso</i>, but the whole poem was written after
the death of the Emperor, and must therefore be
regarded as the work of the closing years of the
poet’s life. On the former hypothesis, the allusion
to the death of Clement V., in <i>Inf.</i> xix., must be
taken as an indefinite prediction or a later insertion.
It is possible to adopt a compromise between
the two views. The poem may have been
begun some time between 1306 and 1308, and portions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
of the <i>Inferno</i> and <i>Purgatorio</i> composed before
the catastrophe of 1313. After the death of
the Emperor, Dante may well have revised and
completed these two canticles. Boccaccio tells us—and
the statement is confirmed (for the <i>Paradiso</i>)
by a sonnet of Giovanni Quirino—that the
poet was wont to send his work in instalments to
Can Grande before any copies were made for
others. There is no evidence of any circulation
before 1317, when some lines from <i>Inf.</i> iii. appear
among the papers of a notary at Bologna.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The
first Eclogue shows that, by 1319, the <i>Inferno</i> and
<i>Purgatorio</i> had been, so to speak, published, and
the <i>Paradiso</i> was in preparation; Boccaccio’s
story of the finding of the last thirteen cantos confirms
the belief that this final canticle, which
crowns the poet’s whole life-work, was only completed
shortly before Dante’s death. Dante is in
the position of a man who is now relating to the
world the vision vouchsafed to him many years
before. Hence everything that happened after
April 1300 is spoken of as future and by way of
prophecy, beginning with Ciacco’s account in <i>Inf.</i>
vi. of the famous faction fight of May Day in that
year. With two exceptions—Frate Alberigo and
Branca d’Oria (<i>Inf.</i> xxxiii.), whose souls went
down to Hell before their bodies died—every spirit
met with in the ecstatic pilgrimage is represented
as having died before April 1300. But Dante
anticipates the certain damnation of some who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
though living in 1300, were dead when he wrote the
poem; Corso Donati, Popes Boniface and Clement,
and a few less notorious sinners as Carlino de’
Pazzi. In one instance, that of Venedico Caccianemico
(<i>Inf.</i> xviii.), he seems to have supposed a
man dead in 1300 who in reality lived a few years
later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time.</span>—Dante’s conferences with the dead open
at sunrise on Good Friday, in his thirty-fifth year.
He would impress upon us that his visionary
world is no mere dreamland, but a terrible reality,
and therefore his indications of time are frequent
and precise. For poetical purposes, he seems to
represent this Good Friday as an ideal Good Friday,
March 25th, which was believed to have been
the actual date of the Crucifixion on the thirty-fourth
anniversary of the Annunciation (<i>cf. Inf.</i>
xxi. 112, and the “three months” from Christmas
Day in <i>Purg.</i> ii. 98). In reality, it fell upon April
8th in 1300; and, when Dante in his pilgrimage
through Hell would mark the time by reference to
moon and stars, he perhaps has recourse to the
ecclesiastical calendar, in which the Paschal full
moon was on Thursday, April 7th (see Dr.
Moore’s <i>Time-References in the Divine Comedy</i>):</p>

<h3>2. <i>The “Inferno”</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantos I. and II.</span>—At break of day on Good
Friday, Dante, in his thirty-fifth year, after a
night of agonised wanderings, would fain issue
from the dark wood into which he has, as it were
in slumber, strayed. This tangled forest represents
at once his own unworthy life and the corruption
of human society; both the “sin of the
speaker” (§ 28) and the “state of misery of those
living in this life” (§ 15) of the Epistle to Can
Grande. He would climb the “mountain of delight”
which, for the individual, represents the
state of felicity, and, for mankind in general, the
goal of civilisation; mystically, it is the mountain
of the Lord, to which only the innocent in hands
and the clean of heart shall ascend. But he is impeded
by a swift and beautiful leopard; terrified
by a lion; driven back by a hideous she-wolf. The
three beasts are derived from Jeremiah (v. 6),
where they stand for the judgments to fall upon
the people for their sins; here they symbolise the
chief vices that keep man from the felicity for
which he is born (<i>Conv.</i> iv. 4): Luxury in its
mediaeval sense of Lust, Pride, Avarice or Cupidity
in its widest meaning. The comparatively
modern interpretation which would see in the
beasts the three great Guelf powers that opposed
the Empire—the republic of Florence, the royal
house of France, the secular power of the Papacy—is
now generally discarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>From this peril Dante is delivered by the spirit
of Virgil, who bids him take another way. The
power of the wolf will extend until the <i>Veltro</i> or
greyhound comes, who will deliver Italy and hunt
the wolf back to Hell. The advent of this Deliverer
is mysteriously announced (<i>Inf.</i> i. 100-111),
and seems to be repeated in other forms at
intervals throughout the poem (<i>Purg.</i> xx. 10-15,
xxxiii. 37-45; <i>Par.</i> xxvii. 61-63). There can be
little doubt that Virgil refers to a future Emperor,
who shall re-establish the imperial power and
make Roman law obeyed throughout the world,
extirpate greed, bring about and preserve universal
peace in a restored unity of civilisation. His
mission will be the realisation of the ideals of the
<i>Monarchia</i>, and will work the salvation of Italy
who will be restored to her former leadership
among the nations. At the same time, there may
possibly be a remoter reference to the second coming
of Christ. This double prophecy would have a
certain fitness upon the lips of Virgil, who was
believed to have sung mystically of the first coming
of Christ in the fourth Eclogue (<i>cf. Purg.</i> xxii.
64-73), as well as of the foundation of Rome and
her Empire in the <i>Aeneid</i>. It has frequently been
supposed that Dante identified the <i>Veltro</i> with
some definite person; of the various claimants to
this honour Can Grande della Scala is, perhaps,
the least improbable. In any case, whatever the
nationality of the deliverer, the Empire of Dante’s
dream was, in fact as well as name, Roman
(<i>cf. Epist. v.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>Human Philosophy can lead man from moral
unworthiness and guide him to temporal felicity;
there are judgments of God to which human reason
can attain. Therefore Virgil will guide Dante
through Hell and Purgatory, that he may understand
the nature of sin and the need of penance
to fill up the void in the moral order; after which
a worthier soul will lead him to Paradise and the
contemplation of celestial things. Dante’s sense
of unworthiness keeps him back, until he learns
that Virgil is but the emissary of Beatrice, to
whom in turn Lucia (St. Lucy) has been sent to
Dante’s aid by a noble Lady in Heaven—evidently
the Blessed Virgin Mary, who may not be named
in Hell, and who symbolises Divine Mercy, as
Lucia does illuminating Grace. Thus encouraged,
Dante follows his guide and master upon “the
arduous and rugged way.” Aeneas had been
vouchsafed his descent to the shades to learn
things that were the cause of the foundation of
the Empire and the establishment of the Papacy
(<i>Inf.</i> ii. 20-27); Dante shall learn things which
may prepare men’s hearts for the restoration of
the imperial throne, and the cleansing of the papal
mantle from the mire of temporal things. St. Paul
was caught up into paradise “to bring confirmation
to that faith which is the beginning of the
way of salvation” (<i>ibid.</i> 29-30); Dante shall follow
him to lead men back to the purity of that
faith, from which they have wandered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ante-Hell.</span>—It is nightfall on Good Friday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
when Dante reads the terrible inscription on the
infernal portal (<i>Inf.</i> iii. 1-9): “Leave all hope, ye
that enter.” The sense of the whole inscription
is hard to him, but Virgil gently leads him in. In
the dark plain of Ante-Hell, disdained alike by
Mercy and by Justice, are those “who lived without
blame and without praise,” mingled with the
Angels who kept neutral between God and Lucifer.
Here the pusillanimous, who, taking no side in the
struggle between good and evil, would follow no
standard on earth, now rush for all eternity after
a banner, “which whirling ran so quickly that it
seemed to scorn all pause.” Further on towards
the centre, flowing round the mouth of Hell itself,
is Acheron; where the souls of the lost assemble,
and are conveyed across by Charon in his boat.
Unconsciously borne across, Dante with Virgil
now stands on the verge of the abyss, hearkening
to the gathering thunder of endless wailings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Structure and Moral Topography of Hell.</span>—Hell
is a vast pit or funnel piercing down to the
centre of the earth, formed when Lucifer and his
Angels were hurled down from Heaven. It lies
beneath the inhabited world, whose centre is Jerusalem
and Mount Calvary; its base towards the
surface, and its apex at the centre. It is divided
into nine concentric circles, the lower of which are
separated by immense precipices—circles which
grow more narrow in circumference, more intense
and horrible in suffering, until the last is reached
where Lucifer is fixed in the ice at the earth’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
centre, at the furthest point from God, buried
below Jerusalem, where his power was overthrown
on the Cross (<i>cf. Inf.</i> xxxiv. 106-126).</p>

<p>“There are two elements in sin,” writes St.
Thomas Aquinas: “the conversion to a perishable
good, which is the material element in sin; and
the aversion from the imperishable good, which is
the formal and completing element of sin.” In
Dante’s Purgatory the material element is purged
away. In his Hell sin is considered mainly on the
side of this formal element, its aversion from the
Supreme Good; and its enormity is revealed in the
hideousness of its effects. The ethical system of
the <i>Inferno</i>, as set forth in Canto xi., combines
Aristotle’s threefold division of “dispositions”
opposed to mortality into Incontinence, Bestiality,
Malice (<i>Ethics</i> vii. 1), with Cicero’s distinction of
the two ways by which injury is done as Violence
and Fraud (<i>De Officiis</i> i. 13). Dante equates the
Aristotelian Bestiality and Malice with the Ciceronian
Violence and Fraud respectively. Thus
there is the upper Hell of sins proceeding from
the irrational part of the soul, divided into five
circles. The lower Hell of Bestiality and Malice
is the terrible city of Dis, the true kingdom of
Lucifer, in which, after the intermediate sixth circle,
come three great circles, each divided into a
number of sub-divisions, and each separated by a
chasm from the one above; the seventh circle of
Violence and Bestiality; followed by two circles
of Malice—the eighth of simple fraud, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
ninth of treachery. There is some doubt as to how
far Dante further equates this division with the
seven capital sins recognized by the Church. Although
actual deeds are considered in Hell, rather
than the sinful propensities which lead to them, it
seems plausible to recognise in Incontinence the
five lesser capital sins: Luxury, Gluttony, Avarice,
Sloth (though the treatment of this vice in the
<i>Inferno</i> is questionable), and Anger; and to regard
the whole of the three circles of the city of
Dis as proceeding from and being the visible effects
of Envy and Pride, the sins proper to devils
according to St. Thomas—seen in their supreme
degree in him whose pride made him rebel against
his Maker, and whose envy brought death into the
world. As an alternative, it may be held that
Dante began the <i>Inferno</i> with the intention of basing
its ethical system upon the seven capital sins,
but abandoned it in favour of a more ample treatment,
and that the earlier design has been preserved
only in the passage through the upper
circles.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Limbo.</span>—In “the first circle that girds the
abyss,” Dante sees in Limbo the unbaptised children
and the virtuous heathen; without hope, they
live in desire; free from physical torment, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
suffer the pain of loss. Here Dante differs from
Aquinas, who distinguishes the Limbo of the
Fathers from the Limbo of the Infants, and who
represents unbaptised children as not grieving at
all for the loss of the Beatific Vision, but rather
rejoicing in natural perfection and a certain participation
of the Divine Goodness. The example
of Rhipeus in the <i>Paradiso</i> shows that Dante could
have saved any of the ancients whom he chose,
without any violence to his creed. “Any one,”
says Aquinas, “can prepare himself for having
faith through what is in natural reason; whence
it is said that, if any one who is born in barbarous
nations doth what lieth in him, God will reveal
to him what is necessary for salvation, either by
internal inspiration or by sending a teacher.” The
reception of Dante by the five great classical poets
as sixth in their company is his own affirmation
of poetical succession; for the first time a poet in
modern vernacular has attained equality with the
masters of antiquity who “wrote poetry with
regulated speech and art” (<i>V. E.</i> ii. 4). With
them he enters the noble castle of Fame, from
which the light of wisdom shone upon the pagan
world; within are all the wise and virtuous spirits
of antiquity, even Aristotle, “the master of those
who know,” whose philosophical authority is for
Dante supreme (<i>Inf.</i> iv. 131). Here, too, are certain
moderns that “worshipped not God aright”;
the Saladin, and Averroës “who made the great
comment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upper Hell.</span>—Out of Limbo Dante and Virgil
descend into the darkness of the second circle,
where the carnal sinners are whirled round and
round, “through the nether storm-eddying
winds.” At its entrance snarls Minos, a type of
the sinner’s disordered and terrified conception
of Divine Justice. The Virgilian “Mourning
Fields” of the martyrs of love are transformed
into a region of active torment, and when, in a
lull in the storm, Francesca da Rimini pours forth
her piteous story in lines of ineffable pathos, the
colouring becomes that of Arthurian romance
(<i>Inf.</i> v.). Down again through the third circle of
putrid rain and snow, where Cerberus (like the
other hellish torturers, merely the effect of the
sin, and the sinner’s own creation) tortures the
gluttonous (<i>Inf.</i> vi.), and the fourth, where Plutus,
demon god of wealth, guards the avaricious and
prodigal butting at each other for all eternity,
Dante is led to the dark waters of Styx, shortly
after midnight, as Friday is passing into the early
hours of Saturday (<i>Inf.</i> vii. 97-99). The marsh of
Styx represents the fifth circle. Fixed in the
slime below are souls, made visible only by the
bubbles from their sighs: “Sullen were we in the
sweet air, that is gladdened by the Sun, carrying
heavy fumes within our hearts: now lie we sullen
here in the black mire” (<i>Inf.</i> vii. 121-124). These
souls are usually identified as the <i>accidiosi</i>, or
slothful. The material element in Sloth is lack of
charity; the formal element is sadness, the sadness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
which takes away the spiritual life and withdraws
the mind from the Divine Good. Some commentators
think that the slothful are placed in the
Ante-Hell, and that these sad souls are those
guilty of sullen or sulky anger, in contrast to the
violent anger of those fiercer spirits who, naked
and miry, are rending each other on the surface
of the marsh, over which the poets are ferried by
Phlegyas, the boatman of Dis, as Charon of Upper
Hell. The Florentine, Filippo Argenti, who
bandies bitter words with Dante during the passage,
connects Anger with Pride (<i>Inf.</i> viii. 46)
and with Bestiality (<i>ibid.</i> 62-63). As Anger leads
to violence and fraud for the sake of vengeance,
so Phlegyas conveys them to the entrance of the
city of Dis, glowing red with eternal fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The City of Dis.</span>—The gate of the city is defended
by fiends, while the Furies appear upon
the turrets, girt with greenest hydras and with
serpents for hair, calling upon Medusa to come
and turn Dante to stone. The Furies are symbols
of hopeless remorse, and Medusa of the despair
which renders repentance impossible. “A guilty
deed is the death of the soul; but to despair is to
go down into Hell” (St. Isidore, <i>cf.</i> Virgil’s words
to Dante, <i>Inf.</i> ix. 55-57). Virgil can guard Dante
from her, but he cannot open the gates; for the
city of Dis is the mediaeval counterpart of the
Virgilian Tartarus, through which the Sibyl could
not lead Aeneas. With the sound of mighty tempest
a messenger of Heaven passes the Styx with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
dry feet, and opens the portal with a little rod;
he is a figure drawn from Mercury in the <i>Aeneid</i>
(iv.), but here transformed to an Angel, akin to
those two terrible beings who summon the dead to
rise in Luca Signorelli’s Last Judgment.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Within
the gate, round the circuit of the walls and at the
same level as the last circle, the sixth circle confines
the Heretics and Epicureans in burning
tombs. They seem to hold this intermediate position
in accordance with the teaching of St. Thomas
that Infidelity, if reduced to one of the capital sins,
must be regarded as arising from Pride, but may
come also from cupidity or some fleshly illusion;
and, in a passage in the <i>Convivio</i> (ii. 9), Dante
appears to reduce one form of Heresy to <i>bestialitade</i>.
Farinata degli Uberti, the Ghibelline hero
of Montaperti, heroic even in Hell, rises to address
his fellow countryman; and, from the same
blazing sepulchre, Cavalcante de’ Cavalcanti,
fondly believing that it is height of genius alone
that leads Dante thus scathless through this blind
prison, seeks vainly to see his own Guido with
him. Emperor and Pope should lead man to
blessedness; but Frederick II. and Pope Anastasius
are buried here with the rest (<i>Inf.</i> x. 119,
xi. 8). The horrible stench that rises from the
abyss forces Dante to delay his descent; and, in
the pause, Virgil explains the moral structure of
Hell, equating the Ciceronian with the Aristotelian
division of vice (<i>Inf.</i> xi.), as already indicated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
and adding a special explanation of how Usury,
the breeding of money from money, is a sin against
nature, and violence against the Diety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seventh Circle.</span>—They descend the precipice
into the seventh circle, at the entrance to which
the Minotaur, emblem of Violence and Bestiality,
gnaws himself in bestial rage, on the top of the
ruin formed by the earthquake when the Redeemer
entered Hell. Since we are now within the Devil’s
city, fiends begin to appear as torturers, but in
this seventh circle they take bestial forms, or
forms which are half-bestial and half-human.
There are three rounds in this circle. In the first,
Phlegethon, the river of boiling blood, the violent
against others are immersed to varying depths,
and tormented by the Centaurs (<i>Inf.</i> xii.). Murderers
and tyrants are here; and Benvenuto supposes
that the Centaurs are types of their own
hireling soldiers, the instruments of their cruelty
upon earth. In the second round, the violent
against themselves (<i>Inf.</i> xiii.) are punished in the
pathless wood of the Harpies; the suicides, imprisoned
in trees and preyed upon by these monsters,
are regarded as bestial sinners, because,
properly speaking, a man cannot hate himself;
the destroyers of their own substance, similarly
considered, are hunted by black hell-dogs. Yet in
this round is one of the noblest souls in the <i>Inferno</i>,
Piero della Vigna, still defending the memory
of the imperial master who caused his death.
Enclosed by the wood is a third round, the burning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
plain (<i>Inf.</i> xiv.), where the violent against
God are subjected to a slow rain of dilated flakes
of fire. Capaneus, the typical blasphemer, is
tortured even more by his own fury than by the
flaming shower. It is in this round that Dante
learns what Virgil tells him is the most notable
thing he has yet seen in his pilgrimage (<i>Inf.</i> xiv.
88): the infernal rivers are produced by the tears
and sins of all human generations since the golden
age, and flow from rock to rock down the circles
of Hell, back to Lucifer at the earth’s core (<i>ibid.</i>
103, etc.). “The tears extorted from the sinners,
the blood shed by tyrants and murderers, all the
filth of the sinful world, flow down below by secret
conduits, and are then transformed into instruments
of torment” (Witte). There are few things
in literature more poignant than Dante’s cry of
recognition: <i>Siete voi qui, ser Brunetto</i> (<i>Inf.</i>
xv. 30), “Are you here, Ser Brunetto?” Nor is
there, perhaps, anything that gives us a more
terrible conception of Dante’s claim to be the
“preacher of justice,” than the fearful doom he
has inflicted upon “the dear and kind paternal
image” of the sage who had taught him how man
makes himself eternal, and upon the great Florentine
citizens of the past, whose deeds and honoured
names he had ever “rehearsed and heard
with affection” (<i>Inf.</i> xvi. 58-60). In the last
group of this round are the Usurers, “on the utmost
limit of that seventh circle,” where violence
passes into fraud (<i>Inf.</i> xvii. 43); and it is worthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
of note that the poet finds examples of this sin,
not among the persecuted Jews, but in the noble
houses of Padua and Florence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Malebolge.</span>—A yawning abyss, down which the
blood-stained Phlegethon dashes with deafening
noise, reaches from the seventh to the eighth circle,
Malebolge, the realm of Malice. Lured up by
the cord which Dante has girt round him and abandons,
Geryon, “unclean image of fraud,” a combination
of the mythological monster with the
apocalyptic Angel of the bottomless pit, bears
Dante and Virgil to the place below. Malebolge
is divided into ten valleys, with a gulf in the centre.
Since they punish Fraud, <i>de l’uom proprio male</i>,
“the vice peculiar to man,” the demon tormentors
have usually something of the human form (the
serpent torturers of the thieves are an exception)—degraded
Angels partaking of humanity’s lowest
features. Disgusting though many details of
this circle may seem to modern taste, they are
only terribly realised images of the sins themselves.
Panders and seducers (<i>Inf.</i> xviii.), flatterers,
simoniacs (xix., Pope Nicholas III.), diviners
and sorcerers (xx.), barrators or sellers of
justice in public offices (xxi. and xxii.), hypocrites
(xxiii.), thieves (xxiv. and xxv.), fraudulent counsellors
(xxvi. and xxvii.), sowers of scandal and
schism (xxviii.), falsifiers of every kind (xxix.
and xxx.)—each class occupies one of the ten valleys
of Malebolge, and to each is awarded a special
form of punishment representing the crime, observing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
the <i>contrapasso</i> (<i>Inf.</i> xxviii. 142), the law
of retribution. In the meanwhile the sun has
risen in the world above, though this makes no
difference in Hell where the sun is silent (<i>Inf.</i> xx.
124); it is the morning of Holy Saturday for the
Church; the bells have been rung again after the
silence of Good Friday, and the <i>Gloria in excelsis</i>
sung in anticipation of the morrow’s feast—while
Dante is rebuking Pope Nicholas for simony, and
hearkening to Guido da Montefeltro’s bitter tale
of Pope Boniface’s treachery (<i>Inf.</i> xxvii.). There
are few nobler utterances of mediaeval Catholicity
than that famous outburst of Dantesque indignation
in Canto xix., against the unworthy and
simoniacal holders of the papal chair, though restrained
by the “reverence for the Great Keys.”
In one instance only does Dante seem in personal
danger, and, curiously enough, it is in the region
of the Barrators (<i>Inf.</i> xxi. and xxii.), with whose
sin his ungrateful countrymen had tried to render
him infamous; Virgil himself is almost deceived,
that is, Dante’s reason is bewildered and his philosophy
at fault; but, although hunted as a criminal,
not a drop of the boiling pitch lights upon
him, nor do the rakes and hooks of the “Evil-claws”
as much as graze his skin. Here and there
images from external nature relieve the horror:
the country shining white with the hoar-frost before
the spring (xxiv. 1-15); the fire-flies gleaming
below the hill after the long summer day (xxvi.
25-30). The two cantos depicting the fate of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
fraudulent counsellors (xxvi. and xxvii.) seem on
a different plane from the rest; the sense of increasing
degradation in the passage downwards
through Malebolge is checked; the story of the
last voyage of Ulysses with its spiritual nobility
and imaginative splendour, the whole episode of
Guido da Montefeltro with its dramatic intensity,
are among the greatest creations of poetry. But
so repulsive is much of the matter of Malebolge
that Dante represents his own moral sense as becoming
clouded; in the last valley he listens without
disgust, almost with pleasure, to an unsavoury
quarrel between the Greek Sinon and the
coiner Adam of Brescia (<i>Inf.</i> xxx.), until a sharp
rebuke from Virgil restores him to himself: <i>Chè
voler ciò udire è bassa voglia</i>, “for to wish to
hear that is a base desire.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ninth Circle.</span>—In the centre of Malebolge
yawns a huge chasm, like an immense well, where
the precipice falls to the ninth and last circle.
Like towers round the margin of this pit appear
the upper parts of captive Giants, both of Scripture
and mythology; Nimrod, Ephialtes, Briareus—the
Paladins of the Emperor of Hell defending
the last and most secret chamber of his palace.
The Giants connect this last circle with Pride
(<i>Purg.</i> xii. 28-36), as the mention of Cain does
with Envy (<i>Purg.</i> xiv. 133), and Lucifer himself
with both Pride and Envy (<i>Inf.</i> vii. 12; <i>Purg.</i> xii.
25; <i>Par.</i> ix. 129, xix. 46, etc.). Treachery is a
gigantic version of fraud, by which “is forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
that love which nature makes, and also that which
afterwards is added, giving birth to special trust”
(<i>Inf.</i> xi. 61-63); hence the guardians of this circle
are monstrosities in magnified human shape. Antaeus
(<i>Inf.</i> xxxi.), less guilty, and therefore less
fettered than the others, hands Virgil and Dante
down into this last circle, where the traitors are
eternally consumed in the river Cocytus, which
is frozen to a vast dark lake of ice, sloping down
to Lucifer. Nowhere else is Dante so utterly pitiless.
Hardly can we recognise the man who had
fainted with pity at the story of Francesca (<i>Inf.</i>
v. 141) in the ruthless inquisitor, who is ready to
add to the torture of Bocca degli Abati (<i>inf.</i>
xxxii. 97), but will not stretch out his hand to
afford a moment’s alleviation to Frate Alberigo
de’ Manfredi (<i>Inf.</i> xxxiii. 149).</p>

<p>There are four concentric rings in this ninth
circle, increasing in pain as they diminish in circumference.
In Caina (<i>Inf.</i> xxxii. 58), the treacherous
murderers of their kindred are chattering
with their teeth like storks. In Antenora (88),
traitors to country or party are still more deeply
frozen into the ice. Bocca degli Abati, who betrayed
the Guelfs to the Ghibellines at Montaperti,
is side by side with Buoso da Duera, who, five
years later, betrayed the Ghibellines to the lieutenant
of Charles of Anjou. Frozen into one hole,
Count Ugolino della Gherardesca is gnawing the
head of Archbishop Ruggieri of Pisa; and the
terror and pity of Dante’s lines have made the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
tale of the dying agonies of the old noble and his
children perhaps the most famous episode in the
<i>Commedia</i>. The terrible imprecation against Pisa
adapts Lucan’s curse upon Egypt after the murder
of Pompey to the different geographical conditions
of the Tuscan city.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In Tolomea (<i>Inf.</i>
xxxiii. 124), those who slew treacherously, under
mask of hospitality, have only their faces showing
above the ice, their tears frozen into a crystalline
mask; on earth their bodies ofttimes still seem to
live, tenanted by a demon until their time is full,
while the soul has already gone down into the ice.
In Giudecca (xxxiv. 117) are souls of traitors to
their lords and benefactors: “Already I was there
(and with fear I put it into verse) where the souls
were all covered, and shone through like straw in
glass. Some are lying; some stand upright, this
on its head, and that upon its soles; another, like
a bow, bends face to feet” (<i>Inf.</i> xxxiv. 10-15);
silent and immovable, in agonised and everlasting
adoration in the court of the Emperor of the dolorious
kingdom, who, gigantic and hideous, “from
mid-breast stood forth out of the ice.” The most
radiant of God’s Angels has become the source
of evil, the symbol of sin’s hideousness. His three
faces, red, yellow-white, black, are an infernal
parody of the Power, Wisdom, Love of the Blessed
Trinity. Under each face are two huge bat-like
wings, whose helpless flappings freeze all the lake
of Cocytus. Tormented by his teeth and claws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
are the three arch-traitors: Judas Iscariot, who
betrayed the Divine Founder of the Church;
Brutus and Cassius, who murdered the imperial
founder of the Empire. The condemnation of the
two latter is an instance of how, while accepting
the testimony of his sources as to facts, Dante
preserves independence of judgment concerning
their moral value; in Lucan’s <i>Pharsalia</i>, Brutus
and Cassius are the destined avengers of right, the
champions of Roman liberty, Brutus bearing the
character with which we are familiar in Shakespeare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Out of the Depths.</span>—It is the night of Easter
Eve in our world (<i>Inf.</i> xxxiv. 68) when the poets
leave the accursed place. Virgil carries Dante like
a child, for man will readily submit himself to the
guidance of reason and philosophy when once the
nature of sin has been thoroughly comprehended.
Down by Lucifer’s shaggy sides, they pass the
centre of the universe (lines 76-81, 106-117). Virgil
turns with Dante completely round (conversion
from sin), so that they find themselves in a chasm
left at Lucifer’s fall, below the opposite hemisphere
to that which man inhabits. But here it
is morning (lines 96, 105, 118), the morning of
Easter Eve of the southern hemisphere, which is
twelve hours behind the time of its antipodes.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Through this space, opposite to “the tomb of
Beelzebub,” a rivulet descends, bringing the memory
of sin that has been purged in Purgatory back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
to Lucifer. By a strange and arduous way, typical
of the persevering struggle out of vice, Dante with
his guide mounts upwards to the clear air; and,
on the shores of Purgatory in the southern hemisphere,
they “issued forth to rebehold the stars.”</p>

<p>Like the Redeemer of mankind, Dante has been
dead and buried part of three days, and it is not
yet daybreak on Easter Sunday, “in the end of the
sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day
of the week.”</p>


<h3>3. <i>The “Purgatorio”</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Structure and Allegorical Meaning.</span>—Purgatory
is a steep mountain of surpassing height,
on the only land rising out of the sea in the southern
hemisphere. Like Hell, it was formed when
Lucifer and his followers were cast out of Heaven.
To escape him the earth rushed up to form this
mountain, and left void the cavern through which
Dante ascended (<i>Inf.</i> xxxiv. 125). It is the exact
antipodes of Jerusalem and Mount Calvary, rises
beyond atmospheric changes, and is crowned by
the Earthly Paradise, scene of man’s fall and
symbol of blessedness of this life.</p>

<p>In the literal sense the Purgatorio is the essential
Purgatory of separated spirits, expiating and
exercising, paying the debt of temporal punishment
that remains after the guilt has been forgiven;
purging away the material element of sin,
after the formal element has been remitted. In the
allegorical sense it represents the moral purgatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
of repentant sinners in this world; and has
for subject man, by penance and good works, becoming
free from the tyranny of vice, attaining
to moral and intellectual freedom. Thus it becomes
a symbol of the whole life of man from
conversion to death; man, no longer sunk in ignorance
and sin, as in the <i>Inferno</i>; not yet soaring
aloft on heights of impassioned contemplation, as
in the <i>Paradiso</i>; but struggling against difficulties
and temptations, making amends for misuse of
Free Will, conforming with the practices of the
Church, and obeying the imperial authority, until
the time comes to pass to the blessedness of another
world.</p>

<p>Dante’s open-air treatment of Purgatory seems
peculiar to him. Very wonderful is the transition
from the dark night of Hell to the “sweet colour
of oriental sapphire,” where the star of Love
comforts the pilgrim soul, and the four stars of
the Southern Cross, which symbolise the cardinal
virtues, make all the sky rejoice in their flame—until
Easter Day dawns, and from afar the poet
“knew the quivering of the sea” (<i>Purg.</i> i. 117).
Throughout this second Cantica the sun is our
guide by day, and at night the stars are over our
head; we behold the glory of sunrise and of sunset
as upon earth, but with added beauty, for it is attended
by celestial songs and the softly beating
wings of angelic presences. Dante spends part of
four days, with three nights, in this portion of his
pilgrimage; for Purgatory is the symbol of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
life of man, and the life of man has four periods.
At the end of each day Dante rests and sleeps;
before dawn on each day, except the first, a vision
prepares him for the work of the day—the work
which cannot begin or proceed save in the light
of the sun, for man can advance no step in this
spiritual expiation without the light of God’s
grace. But the fourth day does not close, like the
other three, in night; for it corresponds to that
fourth and last stage of man’s life, in which the
soul “returns to God, as to that port whence she
set out, when she came to enter upon the sea of
this life” (<i>Conv.</i> iv. 28).</p>

<p>There are three main divisions of the mountain.
From the shore to the gate of St. Peter is Ante-Purgatory,
still subject to atmospheric changes.
Within the gate is Purgatory proper, with its
seven terraces bounded above by a ring of purifying
flames. Thence the way leads up to the
Earthly Paradise; for by these purgatorial pains
the fall of Adam is repaired, and the soul of man
regains the state of innocence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ante-Purgatory.</span>—In Ante-Purgatory Dante
passes Easter Day and the following night. Here
the souls of those who died in contumacy of the
Church are detained at the foot of the mountain,
and may not yet begin the ascent; and the negligent,
who deferred their conversion, and who now
have to defer their purification, are waiting humbly
around the lower slopes. For here purgation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
has not yet begun; this is the place where time
makes amends for time (<i>Purg.</i> xxiii. 84).</p>

<p>Upon the face of Cato, the guardian of the shore
and mountain, so shines the light of the four mystical
stars, that he seems illumined with the very
light of the sun of Divine Grace (<i>Purg.</i> i. 37-39).
Cato, “the severest champion of true liberty,”
“to kindle the love of liberty in the world, gave
proof of how dear he held her by preferring to
depart from life a free man, rather than remain
alive bereft of liberty” (<i>Mon.</i> ii. 5). He was one
of those who “saw and believed that this goal of
human life is solely rigid virtue” (<i>Conv.</i> iv. 6).
Thus from Lucan’s <i>Pharsalia</i>, Dante has recreated
this austere and glorious figure to be the warden
of the spiritual kingdom where virtue is made
perfect by love and true liberty attained.</p>

<p>At sunrise the white-robed and white-winged
Angel of Faith brings the ransomed souls over the
ocean from the banks of the Tiber, where the redeemed
gather, as the lost do upon the shores of
Acheron (<i>Purg.</i> ii.). The <i>In exitu Israel</i> of their
psalm signifies mystically, in Dante’s allegory,
the passing of the holy soul from the bondage of
this corruption to the liberty of eternal glory
(<i>Epist.</i> x. 7). His own song of love on the lips of
Casella has peculiar fitness at the entrance of the
realm of hope and purgation; for, in the eyes of
that mystical lady, of whom Love discourses, is
the anticipation of Paradise, and yet she is the
example of humility—the humility in sign of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
Dante has girded himself with a rush. As they
turn towards the ascent, the excommunicated
draw near, led by Manfred; cut off from the body
of the Church by the Pontiff’s curse, they were
reunited to its soul by tardy repentance. The episode
of Manfred is a counterpart to that of Celestine
in the corresponding canto of the <i>Inferno</i>.
Dante would clearly show the difference of God’s
judgment from that of man. The figure of the
canonised pope-hermit, whom the world extolled
as a perfect type of Christian renunciation, and
who died in the odour of sanctity, is contrasted
with that of the worldly king who died excommunicate,
and whose name was tainted with suspicion
of incest and parricide: “Horrible were
my sins, but Infinite Goodness has such wide arms
that it takes whatever turns to it” (<i>Purg.</i> iii. 121-123).</p>

<p>Through a narrow gap they begin the ascent,
which is so hard at the outset, but grows ever
lighter as man ascends. Among the negligent
through indolence, Belacqua seems as lazy as upon
earth (<i>Purg.</i> iv.); but his laziness is now its own
punishment. At midday Virgil’s swift rebuke
(<i>Purg.</i> v. 10-15) cures his pupil of one fatal obstacle
to following philosophy in the search of
moral and intellectual liberty—human respect.
Among those cut off by violent deaths is Buonconte
da Montefeltro, the story of whose fate, Canto
v., is in designed contrast with the soul’s tragedy
that came from his father’s lips out of the torturing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
flames of Malebolge (<i>Inf.</i> xxvii.). The <i>lacrimetta</i>
of the dying knight—the “little tear” that
saved his eternal part from the fiend (<i>Purg.</i> v.
107)—has become one of the priceless pearls in
the treasury of the world’s poetry. All these souls
ask for remembrance in prayer, that their delay
may be shortened, and Virgil’s explanation centers
upon the power of love to reach for expiation from
beyond the grave (vi. 37-39). In these earlier cantos
of the <i>Purgatorio</i>, there are constant traces of
the deep impression made upon Dante by the story
of Palinurus, the pilot of Aeneas, in Books v. and
vi. of the <i>Aeneid</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Valley of the Princes.</span>—They come to the
solitary and lion-like soul of Sordello, whose loving
greeting to his Mantuan countryman gives
occasion to Dante’s superb and famous outburst
of Italian patriotism: <i>Ahi serva Italia, di dolore
ostello</i> (<i>Purg.</i> vi. 76 <i>et seq.</i>); which shows a striking
correspondence with the great passage where
Lucan laments the overthrow of Roman liberty at
Pharsalia (<i>Phars.</i> vii. 440 <i>et seq.</i>). The part of
Sordello is very similar to that of Musaeus in the
<i>Aeneid</i>, Book vi.; he leads Virgil and Dante to
the Valley of the Princes, which corresponds to
Elysium, the verdant vale where Aeneas met
Anchises. Dante probably reconstructed the troubadour’s
personality from his own famous poem
on the death of Blacatz, a Provençal hero of the
thirteenth century, in which he upbraids and derides
the kings and princes of Christendom, beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
with Frederick II., and ends with a proud
assertion that he will speak the whole truth in
spite of the powerful barons whom he may offend.
So here, in the Valley of the Princes, where those
are detained who neglected some peculiarly lofty
mission, or postponed their spiritual welfare to
worldly and political care, Sordello, beginning
with the Emperor-elect, Rudolph of Hapsburg
(<i>Purg.</i> vii. 94), points out the descendants or successors
of those whom he had rebuked in the
other life. Here, singing together to the Queen of
Mercy, the deadliest foes sit side by side, consoling
each other; Rudolph of Hapsburg with Ottocar of
Bohemia, Charles of Anjou with Peter of Aragon;
a motive found previously in the vision of Tundal,
where, however, the kings are naturally Irish.
On Henry of England Sordello had been more
severe when he lived. After sunset, in the light
of three brighter stars, that symbolise the three
theological virtues, Dante has pleasant talk with
Nino Visconti and Currado Malaspina (<i>Purg.</i>
viii.). And, as evening closes in, two golden-haired
Angels, green-clad and green-winged, the
Angels of Hope with the flaming but blunted
swords of justice tempered with mercy, defend the
noble souls from the assault of an evil serpent. In
the literal sense, this episode (which seems a relic
from earlier mediaeval visions) may imply that
souls in Purgatory have not the intrinsic impossibility
of sinning that is possessed by the blessed
of Paradise, but are kept absolutely free from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
any sin by the Divine Providence. In the allegorical
sense, the meaning clearly is that the way
to moral and intellectual freedom is a hard one,
and temptations to fall back in despair are many.
The tempter would draw man back from regaining
the Earthly Paradise, from which he has once
caused his expulsion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Mystic Eagle and the Gate of Purgatory.</span>—Just
before the dawn Dante dreams of a golden
eagle snatching him up to the sphere of fire, and,
waking when the sun is more than two hours high,
finds that Lucia has brought him to the Gate of
Purgatory. Mystically, the eagle seems to represent
the poet’s own spirit, dreaming that he can
soar unaided to the very outskirts of Paradise;
but he wakes to realise that Divine grace indicates
the preliminary stage of purification. The gate
of St. Peter with its three steps, of white marble,
exactly mirroring the whole man, of darkest purple
cracked in the figure of the Cross, of flaming
red porphyry, represents the Sacrament of Penance
with its three parts: Contrition, Confession,
Satisfaction based upon the love of God. The
mournfully robed Angel of Obedience seated on
the rock of diamond, with dazzling face and flashing
sword, is the confessor. His silver and gold
keys, of judgment and absolution, open the gate
to Dante; the seven P’s traced by his sword on the
poet’s forehead are to be effaced one by one in
his ascent (<i>Purg.</i> ix.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moral Topography.</span>—Within the gate is Purgatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
proper with its seven terraces, each devoted
to the purgation of one of the seven capital sins,
“out of which other vices spring, especially in the
way of final causation” (Aquinas). Whereas in
the <i>Inferno</i> sin was considered in its manifold and
multiform effects, in the <i>Purgatorio</i> it is regarded
in its causes, and all referred to disordered love.
The formal element, the aversion from the imperishable
good, which is the essence of Hell, has been
forgiven; the material element, the conversion
to the good that perishes, the disordered love, is
now to be purged from the soul. In the allegorical
or moral sense, since love, as Aquinas says, is
“the ultimate cause of the true activities of every
agent,” it is clear that man’s first duty in life is
to set love in order; and, indeed, the whole moral
basis of Dante’s Purgatory rests upon the definition
of St. Augustine that virtue is <i>ordo amoris</i>,
“the ordering of love.” In the first three terraces,
sins of the spirit are expiated; in the fourth
terrace, sloth, which is both spiritual and carnal;
in the fifth, sixth, seventh terraces, sins of the
flesh. This purgation, which involves both pain of
loss for a time and punishment of sense, is effected
by turning with fervent love to God and detesting
what hinders union with Him. Therefore,
at the beginning of each terrace, examples are
seen or heard of virtue contrary to the sin, in
order to excite the suffering souls to extirpate its
very roots; and, at the end, examples of its result
or punishment (the “bit and bridle”). These examples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
are chosen with characteristic Dantesque
impartiality alike from Scripture and legend or
mythology; but, in each case, an example from
the life of the Blessed Virgin is opposed to each
capital sin. At the end of each terrace stands an
Angel—personification of one of the virtues opposed
to the sins or vices. These seven Angels
in their successive apparitions are among the
divinest things of beauty in the sacred poem.
It is only when sin is completely purged away
that man can contemplate the exceeding beauty,
the “awful loveliness” of the contrary virtue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Terrace.</span>—Steep and narrow is the path
up to the first terrace, where Pride is purged away
(<i>Purg.</i> x). Carved upon the mountain side are
fair white marble images of wondrous beauty,
setting forth great examples of Humility, alike in
“them of low degree” (Mary at the Annunciation)
and in “the mighty” (David and Trajan,
rulers respectively of the chosen people of the
two dispensations, the Jews and the Romans).
Wearily and painfully the souls of the proud pass
round, pressed down by terrible weights, reciting
a paraphrase of the Lord’s Prayer, for themselves
and those they have left on earth. And seldom
has the Catholic doctrine of prayer for the dead
been more winningly set forth than in Dante’s
comment (xi. 31-36). A partaker in some degree
of their punishment, Dante, all bowed down, goes
with these souls; he speaks with Omberto Aldobrandesco,
who is expiating pride of birth, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
Oderisi of Gubbio, the miniaturist, who is purifying
his soul from pride of intellect. The latter
points out the great Ghibelline burgher statesman
of Siena, Provenzano Salvani, expiating
pride of dominion—the sin which turned so many
an Italian patriot of the Middle Ages into a
tyrant. Figured upon the pavement below their
feet are examples of Pride’s punishment, like the
designs on the pavement of the Duomo of Siena
(<i>Purg.</i> xii.). Noon has passed when the Angel of
Humility shows the way up to the next terrace,
and with the waving of his wing removes the first
P from Dante’s forehead. “Blessed are the poor
in spirit,” celestial voices sing, as, with almost
all weariness gone since Pride is expiated, Dante
ascends the steep way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Terrace.</span>—In the second and narrower
circle Envy is purged. Examples of charity,
“courteous invitations to the table of Love,”
are cited by invisible spirits flying past. The
envious, clothed in haircloth, lean helplessly
shoulder to shoulder against the rock, their eyelids
sewn up with iron stitching. Sapia of Siena,
the kinswoman of Provenzano Salvani, at whose
fall and the defeat of her countrymen she rejoiced,
tells her history in lines of singular beauty (<i>Purg.</i>
xiii.). Guido del Duca denounces the evil dispositions
of the inhabitants of Tuscany, and bewails
the degeneracy of the noble houses with the consequent
decay of chivalry in his own province
of Romagna; envious on earth of prosperity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
others, these souls mourn now for its decline
(xiv.). Like peals of thunder the cries of spirits
follow each other in citing Envy’s punishment. As
they go towards the sunset, the dazzling Angel
of Fraternal Love removes the mark of Envy.
“Blessed are the merciful,” “Rejoice thou that
conquerest.” As they mount Virgil expounds the
difference between material goods, which are diminished
by sharing and beget envy, and the infinite
good of Paradise, where love increases with
every soul that enters into the joy of the Lord, and
its communication is measured only by the charity
of each soul that is made its mirror (<i>Purg.</i> xv.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third Terrace.</span>—On reaching the third terrace
where Anger is purged, Dante sees examples of
meekness and forgiveness in vision. From the
black, pungent, and tormenting smoke which envelopes
the souls of the once wrathful, who now
call upon the Lamb of God for peace and mercy,
the Lombard Marco reconciles Free Will with stellar
influence, and ascribes the evil condition of
Italy and the world to the neglect of law, the confusion
of the spiritual and temporal power, and
the papal usurpation of imperial rights (<i>Purg.</i>
xvi.). In this terrace Dante again partakes of
the pains of the penitent souls. As the sun is setting,
he issues from the dark mist. A most significant
passage on the power of the imagination
to form images not derived from the senses (xvii.
13-18) introduces the visions of Anger’s punishment,
from which the poet is roused by the dazzling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
splendour of the Angel of Peace or Meekness,
who fans away the third P and shows the way up:
“Blessed are the peacemakers who are without
evil wrath.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourth Terrace.</span>—The stars are appearing as
they reach the fourth terrace, where souls are
purged from Sloth. We saw that, in the <i>Inferno</i>,
the Aristotelian division of things to be morally
shunned was discussed, and the ethical structure
of the first canticle expounded, in the circle intermediate
between Incontinence and Malice (<i>Inf.</i>
xi.); so, in the <i>Purgatorio</i>, a compulsory pause in
the terrace intermediate between sins of spirit and
sins of flesh is selected by Virgil for his great discourse
upon Love, on which is based the moral
system of the second realm (<i>Purg.</i> xvii. 91-139,
xviii. 13-75). It is practically a sermon on the
text of Jacopone da Todi, <i>Ordena questo amore</i>,
<i>tu che m’ami</i>, “Set this love in order, thou that
lovest me”; since in rational beings disordered
love produces the seven capital vices. Pride,
Envy, Anger are regarded as distorted love; Sloth
as defective love; Avarice, Gluttony, Luxury as
excessive love. Love is the golden net whereby
God draws back to Himself all creatures that He
has made, whether inanimate, sensitive, or rational—by
the tendencies or inclinations He has given
them to make them seek the end for which they
are ordered and disposed, according to the Eternal
Law. Rational beings alone have Free Will, by
which man merits or demerits from the Divine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
Justice, according as he inclines to good or evil
loves. Love’s tendency to good is the precious
material upon which Free Will acts like the
craftsman’s hand, to fashion a satyr’s mask or a
crucifix.</p>

<p>At the end of this discourse, the slothful rush
by at full speed in the moonlight, so full of longing
to lose no time through too little love, that the
Abbot of San Zeno cannot stop while he answers
Virgil’s question; those in front cry out examples
of alacrity in Mary and Caesar; those behind
chant Sloth’s punishment in the chosen people of
the Old Testament and the Trojan ancestors of
the Romans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Siren and the Angel of Zeal.</span>—Before
the dawn of the third day in Purgatory, Dante has
in his sleep a marvellous dream of the Siren (sensual
seduction, concupiscence of the flesh), from
which he is delivered by a holy and alert lady who
calls upon Virgil (prevenient grace, or the wisdom
and prudence of Proverbs vii.). The Siren is the
dream-prelude to the purgation of sins of the
flesh, as the Eagle had been to that of sins of the
spirit. The sun has risen; and the Angel of Zeal
(or of Spiritual Joy) cancels the fourth P and
shows the way up to the next terrace. “Blessed
are they that mourn, for they shall have their
souls wed to consolation.” Sloth is a heaviness
and sadness which weighs down the soul, a sadness
at spiritual good, to be fought by thinking on spiritual
things. Most fitly then do the wings of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
Angel of Zeal point upwards, and his words tell of
a nobler sorrow, a mourning which shall be followed
by Divine consolation (<i>Purg.</i> xix.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fifth Terrace.</span>—In the fifth terrace, the avaricious
and prodigal, whose souls on earth cleaved
to the dust, lie face downwards to earth; unable to
move hand or foot until the sin of Covetousness is
purged away, the sin which, according to Aquinas,
“although not absolutely the greatest of sins, yet
has in some sense a greater deformity than the
rest, since by it the human heart is subjected even
to external things.” Pope Adrian V. tells the
story of his tardy conversion, and has tender
words for his niece Alagia, the wife of Moroello
Malaspina (<i>Purg.</i> xix.). It is a companion episode
to that of Nicholas III. in the corresponding
canto of the <i>Inferno</i>. In this circle the souls themselves
cry out the examples and warnings, by day
and night respectively. The soul of Hugh Capet,
“the root of the evil plant which overshadows all
the Christian earth,” pours forth bitter sarcasm
and scathing invective upon all the royal house
of France, the great Guelf power that opposed
the Empire, oppressed Italy, and wrought scandal
in the Church. A monument of poetic infamy is
especially raised to Philip the Fair and the three
Carlos; and there are few more glorious examples
of Christian magnanimity than the burning words
in which Dante, distinguishing the man from the
office, brands the sacrilege of Anagni, the outrage
committed upon him whom the poet held as his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
own deadliest foe, and yet the unworthy Vicar of
Christ. Nowhere else, save in the reference to the
Jubilee (<i>Purg.</i> ii. 98, 99), does Dante treat Boniface
as lawful pope (<i>cf. Inf.</i> xix. 52-57; <i>Par.</i> ix.
142, xxvii. 22-24). It has been thought that Canto
xx. was composed while the Church was ostensibly
supporting the policy of Henry VII.; before attacking
the Templars, the French king had endeavoured
to renew the outrage of Anagni by inducing
Pope Clement to condemn the memory of
Boniface. With a mighty earthquake, a universal
chorus of <i>Gloria in excelsis</i> from the suffering
souls, the poet Statius is liberated, and joins
Dante and Virgil (<i>Purg.</i> xxi.). He explains how
the pains of Purgatory are voluntarily endured,
since, against the hypothetic or absolute will with
which they desire the bliss of Paradise, the souls
suffer these purifying pains with the conditional
or actual will, the same inclination or impulse or
desire (<i>talento</i>) which they formerly had to sin.
Thus it is free will itself that imposes the purgatorial
process, and that alone shows the soul when
purification is complete. The delicious scene of
the recognition of Virgil by Statius is full of that
peculiarly tender Dantesque playfulness that informs
the two Eclogues; Dante’s affectionate humour
in dealing with those he loved is one of the
most attractive aspects of his character, and one

<p><span class="smcap">Sixth Terrace.</span>—The Angel of Justice has removed
the fifth P from Dante’s forehead, opposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
in his song the thirst of justice to that of gain. As
they mount, Statius explains to Virgil how he was
converted from prodigality by a line in the <i>Aeneid</i>,
and led to Christianity by the fourth Eclogue
(<i>Purg.</i> xxii.). The conversion of a pagan to Christianity
through reading Virgil occurs in a story
told by Vincent of Beauvais; Dante was probably
influenced in applying this to Statius, representing
him as a secret convert to the true faith, by his
study of the <i>Thebaid</i>; for there, in the last book,
Statius describes the Altar of Mercy at Athens
in language which harmonises with the words of
Christ in the Gospels and the address of his own
contemporary, St. Paul, to the Athenians in the
Acts. The poets pursue their way with greater
confidence now that Statius is with them, and
reach the sixth terrace, where unseen spirits cry
out examples of temperance from the tree beneath
which drunkenness and gluttony are purged. The
spirits, terribly wasted, suffer intense torments of
hunger and thirst in the presence of most tempting
food and drink; but the sanctifying pain is a
solace, desired even as Christ willed to die for
man. With the soul of Forese Donati, Dante holds
loving converse; the memory of their dissolute
lives together is still grievous; the poet makes
amends for his old slander of Forese’s wife Nella,
by the tender lines now placed upon her husband’s
lips (<i>Purg.</i> xxiii. 85-93). Forese darkly foretells
the death of Corso Donati, which appears to be the
latest event in Florentine history mentioned in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
poem (xxiv. 82-90). Whatever the friendship of
these two had been on earth, it was fair and lovely
indeed on the Mount of Purgation.</p>

<p>Amongst many others are Pope Martin IV. and
the poet Bonagiunta of Lucca, whose talk with
Dante upon the <i>dolce stil nuovo</i>, the “sweet new
style,” is one of the landmarks for the student of
poetry (<i>Purg.</i> xxiv. 49-60). Dante’s famous definition
of his own position expresses, in another
form, the truth that all great poetry is the “transfigured
life” of its author:<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> “I am one who, when
Love inspires me, note, and give utterance in that
fashion which he dictates within.” It is already
anticipated in the prose passage prefixed to the
<i>Donne che avete</i> in the <i>Vita Nuova</i> (xix.), and
completes the conception of poetry set forth in the
<i>De Vulgari Eloquentia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Seventh Terrace.</span>—Passing another tree,
a shoot from the tree of knowledge, beneath which
the purging pangs are renewed, and from whose
branches spirit voices proclaim examples of gluttony’s
punishment, they are summoned upwards
by the glowing and dazzling Angel of Abstinence,
fragrant with grass and flowers as the air of May.
As they ascend the narrow stairs towards the last
terrace, Statius explains the generation of the
body and the infusion of the rational soul, which
exists, after the body’s death, invested with an
aerial body as a shade (<i>Purg.</i> xxv. 31 <i>et seq.</i>). Apparently
it is because revelation has some voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
in these high matters that the Christian Statius
gives Dante this exposition, instead of Virgil, and
at the latter’s request; until the seventh terrace is
reached, where sensual passion is expiated in the
bosom of the great burning. Singing to the God
of Supreme Clemency, crying aloud examples of
chastity or of lust’s punishment, two bands of
souls, divided according to the nature of their
sin, pass through the fire in opposite ways (<i>Purg.</i>
xxvi.). Here is Guido Guinizelli of Bologna,
father of the poets of the <i>dolce stil nuovo</i>, whom
Dante gazes upon in rapt admiration, and addresses
with impassioned love and worship. But
Guinizelli—with that humility which is so characteristically
Dante’s own—indicates as <i>miglior
fabbro del parlar materno</i>, a “better craftsman of
his mother-tongue,” Arnaut Daniel, the cunning
Provençal song-smith, who invented the sestina,
and whose metrical skill and originality won for
him a higher place in the estimation of the poet
of the <i>rime pietrose</i> than modern students of the
troubadours are usually disposed to concede.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Purging Fire.</span>—At sunset the Angel of
Purity, singing “Blessed are the clean of heart,”
bids the poets pass through the flames that lie
between them and the last stairway—the purging
fire that is the wall between Dante and Beatrice.
Dante endures the “burning without measure”;
and they reach the ascent, greeted by dazzling
light and celestial strains of <i>Venite benedicti Patris
mei</i>. The Cherubims with the flaming sword,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
“turning every way to keep the way of the tree of
life” (Gen. iii. 24), are thus welcoming man’s restoration
to the Garden of Eden, as the serpent had
endeavoured to impede it in the Valley of the
Princes. Now it is a delight to mount; but night
comes on, and Dante, watched over by Statius and
Virgil, falls asleep on the stairs (<i>Purg.</i> xxvii.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leah and Liberty.</span>—Just before dawn, prelude
to the new day, he dreams of Leah, a young and
lovely lady gathering flowers in a meadow. The
theologians took Leah as type of the active life,
and Rachel, her sister, of the contemplative; a
symbolism to which Richard of St. Victor gave a
more mystical colour, by interpreting Leah as
“affection inflamed by divine inspiration, composing
itself to the norm of justice.” Leah may then
represent the affection, thus inflamed and ordered,
which is the perfection of the active life. At sunrise
the topmost stair of Purgatory is reached, and
Virgil, who can himself discern no further, resigns
his guidance at the entrance to the Garden of
Eden. Dante’s judgment has been made free,
right, and whole; <i>per ch’ io te sovra te corono e
mitrio</i>, “wherefore I crown and mitre thee over
thyself” (xxvii. 142). It has been supposed that
Virgil is here resigning to Dante the crown and
mitre of the Emperor; <i>mitratus et coronatus</i> was
the expression used for the coronation of an Emperor
when the Pope placed upon his head a mitre
and a crown, which afterwards were united in the
mitred crown, as seen in the great fresco at Santa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
Maria Novella. Others refer the crown to temporal
or imperial authority, and the mitre to spiritual
or ecclesiastical; for (<i>Mon.</i> iii. 4) “if man
had remained in the state of innocence in which he
was made by God, he would have had no need of
such directive regimens,” which are “remedial
against the infirmity of sin.” Dante, purified
from sin, has regained this state of innocence, and
has attained that liberty through which “we have
our felicity here as men and our felicity elsewhere
as Gods” (<i>Mon.</i> i. 12). In any case, Virgil is confirming
the freedom which Dante has sought and
gained by the passage through Purgatory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Earthly Paradise and Matelda.</span>—The
Earthly Paradise represents “blessedness of this
life, which consists in the exercise of man’s natural
powers” (<i>Mon.</i> iii. 16). This blessedness is
found in the twofold exercise of the mind: the
practical, which “consists in ourselves working
virtuously, that is, in integrity, with prudence,
with temperance, with fortitude, and with justice”;
and the speculative, which consists “in considering
the works of God and of nature” (<i>Conv.</i>
iv. 22). In this Earthly Paradise, the music of
whose birds and trees has surely passed into the
wonderful six cantos that close the <i>Purgatorio</i>,
Dante meets, amidst the flowers on Lethe’s banks,
the glorified realisation of the Leah of his dream
(<i>Purg.</i> xxviii.). She has been taken as symbolising
the glorified active life in the state of recovered
Eden, realising in the Church of Christ what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
Leah had dimly prefigured in the Old Testament;
the active Christian life; <i>innocentia bonorum
operum</i>, the virtuous use of earthly things, directly
ordered to the love of our neighbour; the temporal
felicity of the Earthly Paradise. Since the
purgatorial process is the freeing of the soul from
disordered love, we may follow Richard’s interpretation
of Leah, and take her as representing
love rightly ordered and inflamed by divine inspiration.
Presently she is called Matelda (xxxiii.
119), and it is probable that she is the idealised
presentment of a real person. All the earliest
commentators, excepting the <i>Ottimo</i>, identify her
with the great Countess of Tuscany, in support of
which view might be urged the historical work of
the Countess in the revival of the study of Roman
Law at Bologna—Roman Law being, for Dante,
the secular counterpart of the “perfect law of
liberty.” Some modern commentators prefer to
seek her prototype in one or other of the ladies of
<i>Vita Nuova</i>; for instance, in that lady of very
sweet speech who had rebuked Dante at the crisis
of his “new life.” Others have attempted to identify
her with Mechthild of Magdeburg or Mechthild
of Hackeborn, two German mystical writers
of the latter part of the thirteenth century whose
works show occasional analogies with the <i>Commedia</i>.
It may be observed that her counterpart, as
Rachel to Leah, is not Beatrice, as sometimes supposed,
but St. Bernard, in the closing cantos of the
<i>Paradiso</i>. Matelda explains her joyous aspect by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
referring Dante to the Psalm <i>Delectasti</i> (Ps. 92,
91 Vulgate), and her discourse of Eden and its
rivers (realising the Golden Age sung by the classical
poets) communicates to Virgil and Statius
her own celestial joy: “Thou has given me, O
Lord, a delight in what Thou hast made: in the
works of Thy hands I shall rejoice.” She points
out to Dante’s gaze the wondrous pageant, which
astonishes Virgil as much as his pupil, the mystical
procession that represents the triumphal
march of the Church (<i>Purg.</i> xxix.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pageant of the Church.</span>—With brilliant
light and ineffable melody, the triumph advances:
“I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming
down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride
adorned for her husband” (Rev. xxi. 2). Headed
by seven candlesticks of gold as standards, followed
by the twenty-four elders, white-robed and
crowned with lilies, singing Mary’s praises; between
the four living creatures of Ezekiel and
St. John, crowned with green, comes a triumphal
chariot, more glorious than the sun, upon two
wheels; drawn by a Griffin, half lion and half
eagle, whose golden wings stretch up far out of
sight, through the seven luminous bands that form
the processional canopy. By the right wheel dance
three maidens, symbolic of the theological virtues;
by the left wheel dance four, who represent the
cardinal virtues, following the measure of Prudence,
as the others take their step from the song
of Charity. The seven candlesticks are the gifts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
of the Holy Spirit; the twenty-four elders, either
the patriarchs and prophets, or the books of the
Old Testament; the four living creatures, the four
Evangelists, or their four Gospels; the Griffin,
Christ Himself in His Human and Divine Natures.
Lastly, follow seven more elders, white-robed but
crowned with flaming red flowers; a physician, and
one with shining sword; four of humble appearance;
an old man “sleeping with face alert.”
According to Benvenuto da Imola, these represent
St. Peter (who had intrusted to him the power of
healing souls) and St. Paul, the four great Latin
doctors, and St. Bernard. More usually they are
regarded as personifying the books of the New
Testament—the Acts, St. Paul’s Epistles, the
Epistles of St. Peter, James, John, and Jude, the
Apocalypse or Revelation of St. John. Upon the
chariot, amidst a hundred Angels singing and scattering
flowers, Beatrice appears, clad in the mystical
colours, red, white, green, crowned with the
olive of wisdom and of peace over her snow-white
veil. And, at the advent of the Wisdom divinely
revealed to man, Virgil silently vanishes; he has
tasted of the delights of the Earthly Paradise, has
witnessed the triumph of the Church from which
he is for ever cut off, the Faith he never knew,
and has gone back to his mournful dwelling-place
(<i>Purg.</i> xxx.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice and Dante.</span>—The precise significance
of the reproaches which Beatrice pours upon
Dante for his mode of life after her death, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
poet’s own bitter shame and intense repentance
(xxx., xxxi.), depends upon the view taken of
his character and the nature of the wanderings
represented in the dark wood. That these aberrations
were mainly philosophical and intellectual,
as sometimes supposed, appears highly improbable.
We would regard Dante’s confession here
as one of his most personal utterances, and hold
that the cherubically inspired singer of righteousness
is deliberately casting aside the allegorical
veil which, in the <i>Convivio</i>, he had attempted to
throw over the things in the past which still severed
him from the ideal life when he wrote: “I
fear the infamy of having followed such great
passion.” It is a personal episode, in which Beatrice
is the woman loved and to whose memory the
poet has been unfaithful, standing out clearly from
the allegorical mystery by which it is surrounded
and in which it is set. After Matelda has drawn
Dante through Lethe, the four cardinal virtues,
which “perfect the intellect and appetite of man
according to the capacity of human nature,” lead
him to the breast of the mystic Griffin; and, in
response to the song of the three theological virtues,
which perfect man supernaturally, Beatrice
at last unveils her countenance to his gaze: “O
splendour of living light eternal.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Concluding Allegories of the “Purgatorio.”</span>—The
allegory is resumed. In the light of this
revelation, now that he is purified and free from
sin, Dante beholds a vision of the Church and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
Empire (<i>Purg.</i> xxxii.). That glorious procession
had first presented an ideal of the Church as Divine
Providence intended it to be, before it became
the vessel that the serpent of simony broke; the
Bride that the Divine Spouse ordained for the
guidance of the world. Such being the ideal,
Dante beholds in a series of allegorical visions its
history, in conjunction with the Empire, from the
first coming to Rome down to the transference of
the papal chair to Avignon. The great procession
moves on through the divine forest, the Griffin
still drawing the chariot with Beatrice seated
upon it; Matelda with Dante and Statius following
after the right wheel. Even as the divine origin
of the Church has been seen in the triumphal car,
so now the divine origin of the Empire is indicated
in the desolate and despoiled tree which they
reach. The tree of knowledge of good and evil,
since the prohibition to eat of that tree was the
beginning of law and the duty of obedience, represents
Natural Law or Natural Justice, what Dante
calls <i>ius</i>; which “in things is nought else than the
similitude of the divine will” (<i>Mon.</i> ii. 2). The
expression of this natural justice and the means
for its effectuation in human society is Law, which
Dante identifies with the Empire, and thus the tree
becomes the symbol of the Empire and of the
obedience due to it. The tree is destitute of flowers
and foliage till the Griffin comes to it, who
plucks nothing from it: “Thus is preserved the
seed of all justice” (<i>Purg.</i> xxxii. 48; <i>cf.</i> our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
Lord’s words to St. John, Matt. iii. 15). Justice
can alone be fulfilled when the Church follows this
example of her Divine Founder, and usurps none
of the temporal rights of the Empire. After the
chariot has been bound to the tree, the previously
bare plant breaks out into purple leaves and flowers.
The Griffin and his train return to Heaven,
leaving Beatrice to guard the chariot of the Church,
seated beneath the shadow of the Imperial Tree,
upon its root, which is Rome. In a new series of
visions Dante beholds the sequel; he sees the conflict
of the past, contemplates the corruption of
the present, hearkens to the hope of the future.
The persecution of the Church by the early Roman
Emperors is followed by the inroad of the first
heresies; and the donation of Constantine by the
rising of the dragon of schism or simony. By
more assumption of secular power and dignities,
the chariot becomes monstrously transformed,
and shamelessly usurped by the harlot, who represents
the corrupt ecclesiastical authority enthroned
in the place of Revelation, a false and degraded
theology based upon the Decretals instead
of the true divine science of the Scripture and
the Fathers. By her side a giant appears who,
after alternate caressing and scourging of the
usurper, unbinds the transfigured chariot from
the tree, and drags it away through the forest—symbolical
of the interference of the royal house
of France, ending in the transference of the Papacy
from Rome to Avignon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Deliverer Announced.</span>—But to the mournful
psalm that the maidens around her raise, <i>Deus venerunt
gentes</i>, Beatrice answers in words of hope;
“a little while,” and the spiritual guide shall rise
again from the black tomb of Avignon. And, as
they move on, she utters to Dante a further prophecy
(<i>Purg.</i> xxxiii.). “The vessel that the serpent
broke was and is not,” so completely has corruption
and simony degraded the chariot of the Bride
of Christ. But vengeance shall fall upon the
guilty parties, and the eagle shall not for ever be
without an heir; for already a favourable disposition
of the stars is at hand, under which a messenger
of God shall come, who shall slay the harlot
and the giant. It is probably the same event as
the coming of the <i>Veltro</i>. Dante is to repeat her
words “to those that live the life which is a running
to death,” and not to conceal what he has
seen of the tree. Apparently (<i>Purg.</i> xxxiii. 58-72)
he is to make manifest that the Empire is of divine
origin, and to recognise that the precept given by
God to our first parents corresponds now with the
duty and obedience man owes to the Empire. The
law under which Adam lived was the prohibition to
eat of the tree; the law under which his descendants,
the commonwealth of the human race, live
is the Empire. As Parodi puts it, it is not a new
sense superimposed upon the first; “it is simply
the same single meaning, the historical circumstances
alone appearing changed.” The sin of
Adam is repeated when the Empire is usurped of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
its rights or its authority attacked, for God created
it holy for the purpose of leading man to temporal
felicity—the goal, here and now, of the
human race.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lethe and Eunoë.</span>—At noon they come to where
the rivers of Lethe and Eunoë issue from one
mystical fountain, the fountain of the grace of
God. Here Beatrice refers Dante to Matelda, who
leads him and Statius to drink of Eunoë, which
quickens dead virtue and restores memory of
every good deed in those who have first been
bathed in Lethe, which takes away the memory of
sin. According to St. Thomas Aquinas (<i>Summa</i>,
iii. 89, 5), works done in charity, although in a
sense dead through sin, are brought to life through
penance. Through repentance they regain their
efficacy of leading him who did them into eternal
life. Therefore Dante writes: “I returned from
the most holy stream, remade even as young trees
renewed with new foliage, pure and disposed to
ascend to the stars.”</p>


<h3>4. <i>The “Paradiso”</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Structure.</span>—Dante’s Paradise consists of the
nine moving heavens, according to Ptolemaic
astronomy, crowned by the tenth motionless and
divinest Empyrean heaven, “according to what
Holy Church teacheth, who cannot lie” (<i>Conv.</i> ii.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
3, 4). The nine moving spheres revolve round our
globe, the fixed centre of the Universe, each of the
lower eight being enclosed in the sphere above
itself. The seven lowest are the heavens of the
planets: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun,
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. The eighth or stellar
heaven, the sphere of the Fixed Stars or Firmament,
is the highest visible region of the celestial
world, and to some extent corresponds to the
Earthly Paradise in the lower realms. Above
this visible firmament, the ninth or Crystalline
heaven, the <i>Primum Mobile</i>, directs with its movements
the daily revolution of all the others. In
it nature starts; from it proceed time and motion,
with all celestial influence for the government of
the world (<i>Par.</i> xxvii. 106-120). It is “the royal
mantle of all the volumes of the world, which is
most fervent and most living in God’s breath,
and in His ways” (<i>Par.</i> xxiii. 112-114); and it
communicates in different degrees some participation
in this quickening breath of God to the
other sphere which it encloses, and to all the Universe.
It moves swiftest of all, from the fervent
desire of all its parts to be united to the Empyrean,
the spaceless and motionless ocean of Divine
love, where God beatifies the saints and Angels in
the vision of His Essence. This Empyrean is the
true intellectual Paradise, for which the lower
heavens are merely sensible preparations. “This
is the sovereign edifice of the world, in which all
the world is included, and outside of which is nothing;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
and it is not in space, but was formed only in
the First Mind” (<i>Conv.</i> ii. 4); “The heaven that
is pure light; light intellectual full of love, love
of true good full of joy, joy that transcendeth
every sweetness” (<i>Par.</i> xxx. 39-42).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gradations.</span>—Each of the nine lower spheres
represents a step higher in knowledge, in love, in
blessedness, until in the true Paradise the soul
attains to perfect knowledge, supreme love, and
infinite blessedness in union with the First Cause,
in the Beatific Vision of the Divine Essence. The
ascent is marked by the increased loveliness of
Beatrice, as she guides Dante upwards from
heaven to heaven; it is marked, too, by gradations
in the brilliancy of the blessed spirits themselves,
by their ever increasing ardour of charity towards
the poet, and by the growing spirituality of the
matters discussed in each sphere—veil after veil
being drawn aside from the mysteries of the Divine
treasure-house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Saints.</span>—“To show forth the glory of beatitude
in those souls,” says the letter to Can
Grande, “from them, as from those who see all
truth, many things will be sought which have great
utility and delight” (<i>Epist.</i> x. 33). All the saints
without exception have their home and glorious
seats with Mary and the Angels in that Empyrean
heaven, where they are finally seen as glorified
spirit likenesses of what they were on earth. But
into each preparatory sphere, excepting the ninth,
these citizens of eternal life descend to meet Dante<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
as, with Beatrice, he approaches the gates of the
celestial city—like the noble soul returning home
to God in the fourth and last part of life:</p>

<p>“And even as its citizens come forth to meet
him who returns from a long journey, before he
enters the gate of the city, so to the noble soul
come forth, as is fitting, those citizens of eternal
life. And thus they do because of her good works
and contemplations; for, being now rendered to
God and abstracted from worldly things and
thoughts, she seems to see those whom she believes
to be with God” (<i>Conv.</i> iv. 28).</p>

<p>In all these spheres, excepting the first, and to
some extent the second, the spirits of the blessed
appear clothed in dazzling light, which hides their
proper semblances from Dante’s gaze, making
them appear as brilliant stars or flaming splendours.
In the tenth Heaven of Heavens he is
supernaturally illumined, and enabled thereby to
behold them in their glorified spirit forms “with
countenance unveiled” (<i>Par.</i> xxii. 60, xxx. 96,
xxxi. 49).</p>

<p>In the three lower heavens, to which earth’s
shadow was supposed to extend (<i>Par.</i> ix. 118,
119), appear the souls whose lives were marred by
inconstancy in their vows, who were moved by
vain glory, or yielded to sensual love. They
descend into these lower spheres to give Dante
a sensible sign of the lesser degree of the perfection
of their beatitude in the Empyrean. <i>Domus
est una, sed diversitas est ibi mansionum</i>; “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
house is one, but there is a diversity of mansions
there.” There are different mansions of beatitude
in God’s house, proceeding from inequality
in the soul’s capacity of the Divine Charity; but
in that house all are fulfilled with the Vision of
the Divine Essence, and each perfectly beatified
according to his own capacity of love and knowledge.
In the spheres of the four higher planets
appear the souls of great teachers and doctors, of
Jewish warriors and Christian knights, of just
rulers, of ascetic monks and hermits; they appear
as types of lives perfected in action or in contemplation,
as a sign of the different ways in
which perfection may be reached on earth and
beatitude attained in Paradise. These successive
manifestations in the seven spheres of the planets
obviate what might otherwise have proved the
monotony of a single heaven, and suggest that,
although each soul partakes supremely according
to its individual capacity of the Beatific Vision,
which is essentially one and the same in all, yet
there are not only grades but subtle differences in
the possession of it, in which the life on earth was
a factor. In the eighth, the Stellar Heaven, still
under sensible figures and allegorical veils, Dante
sees “the host of the triumph of Christ, and all
the fruit gathered by the circling of these spheres”
(<i>Par.</i> xxiii. 19-21), representing the Church in
which these various modes and degrees of life are
brought into unison. In the ninth, the Crystalline,
the angelic hierarchies are manifested with imagery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
symbolical of their office towards God and man,
representing the principle of Divine Order, the
overruling and disposition of Divine Providence
in which the celestial intelligences are the agents
and instruments. The Empyrean Heaven depicts
the soul <i>in patria</i>, with all the capacities of love
and knowledge actualised in the fruition of the
Ultimate Reality, the supreme and universal truth
which is the object of the understanding, the supreme
and universal good which is the object of
the will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Angels.</span>—Each of the nine moving spheres
is assigned to the care of one of the nine angelic
orders: Angels, Archangels, Principalities; Powers,
Virtues, Dominations; Thrones, Cherubim,
Seraphim. And the character of the blessed spirits
that appear to Dante in each heaven, and the
subjects discussed, seem in almost every case to
correspond more or less closely with the functions
assigned by mystical theologians, especially Dionysius,
St. Gregory and St. Bernard, to the special
angelic order which presides over the sphere in
question. There are two fundamental principles
in the life of the soul: nature and grace. The one
is represented in the <i>Paradiso</i> by the astronomical
order of the heavens and their influence upon individual
disposition, furnishing man with a natural
aptitude for the moral and intellectual virtues;
the other by the bounty of Divine Grace, which reveals
itself in the perfecting of the natural and
the infusion of the supernatural virtues, whereby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
souls become assimilated to the angelic orders.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
It is through these Angels (the name is applied
generally to all, as well as to the lowest order)
that God disposes the visible world; in the hands
of the celestial intelligences the heavens are as
hammers, to stamp the Divine ideas upon material
creation and carry out the Divine plan in the government
of the Universe (<i>cf.</i> <i>Par.</i> ii. 127-129).
And, by means of the influence of the stars, these
Angels have impressed certain men with their own
characteristics; perhaps to fill up the vacant
places in their ranks left by the fall of Lucifer’s
followers, certainly to co-operate on earth in their
work. Dante himself was born beneath the constellation
of the Gemini, the glorious stars impregnated
with the virtue of the Cherubim who
rule the eighth sphere (<i>Par.</i> xxii. 112-123). The
Cherubim represent the Divine Wisdom; their
name signifies plenitude of knowledge. According
to St. Bernard, they “draw from the very
fountain of wisdom, the mouth of the Most High,
and pour out the streams of knowledge upon all
His citizens.” Their special prerogatives are
fullness of Divine light, and contemplation of the
beauty of the Divine order of things; they see
most into the profound mysteries of the hidden
things of God, and spread the knowledge of Him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
upon all beneath them. By their inspiration Dante
co-operated in this cherubical work by writing the
<i>Divina Commedia</i>. The Seraphim especially represent
the Divine Love. No soul appears in the
ninth heaven which they guide and in which the
angelic hierarchies are manifested; Beatrice is
the sole interpreter between the poet and the
Angels, as she had been the revealer to him on
earth of Love’s “possible divinities and celestial
prophecies.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time in Paradise.</span>—The action of the <i>Paradiso</i>
begins at noon, immediately after Dante’s return
from Eunoë; that is, noon on Wednesday in Easter
week in the Earthly Paradise and (the following)
midnight at Jerusalem (<i>Par.</i> i. 37-45). The time-references
in this third Cantica are rather doubtful
(<i>Par.</i> xxii. 151-153, xxvii. 77-87), but it seems
probable that Dante takes twenty-four hours to
ascend through the nine material heavens to the
Empyrean, which is beyond time and space, where
“the natural law in nought is relevant” (<i>Par.</i>
xxx. 123). When Dante woke from his “mighty
trance” to the “sound of the importunate earth,”
it was perhaps about dawn on the morning of Friday
in Easter week in our world, thus completing
the seven days of his ecstatic pilgrimage, which
had begun at about the same hour on Good Friday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Canto I.</span>—In a lyrical prologue of stately music
(<i>Par.</i> i. 1-36), the poet sings of the glory of the
First Mover, and prays for light and inspiration
to complete this third most arduous portion of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
divine poem. Then, in the noblest season of the
year and noblest hour of the day, as Beatrice gazes
upon the sun and Dante upon her, his mind becomes
godlike, and he ascends to Heaven swifter
than lightning. To explain his ascent, Beatrice
discourses upon the form and order of God’s visible
image, the Universe; and on His Eternal Law,
the sovereign plan of government existing in the
Divine Mind, to which all movements and actions
of nature are subject (<i>ibid.</i> 103-141). To all created
things God has given an instinct, or principle
of inclination, by which, in different ways according
to their nature, He draws them all back to
Himself over the great sea of being. Rational
beings alone can resist the order of the Universe
and defeat the Eternal Law by sin, which is expiated
by temporary or eternal suffering, as Dante
has seen in the lower realms; but the purified soul,
in accordance with this order and law, inevitably
mounts up to find its rest in union with the First
Cause. It is the doctrine of spiritual gravitation
(derived from St. Augustine), according to which
the soul is moved by love as bodies are by their
weight, and all things find their rest in order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Heaven of the Moon.</span>—They are received
into the eternal pearl of the Moon (<i>Par.</i> ii.); where
Beatrice first confutes Dante’s former theory concerning
the luminous substance of the celestial
bodies, and, by explaining how everything in the
visible world depends upon the angelic movers of
the sphere, gives a mystical interpretation of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
natural phenomenon, on this first step of his ascent
to the suprasensible. Within this eternal pearl
appear faint but divinely beautiful forms of women;
the souls of those who had yielded to violence
and broken their solemn vow (<i>Par.</i> iii.). Piccarda
Donati, sister of Corso and Forese, sets forth the
perfection of celestial charity, where all wills are
made absolutely one with the will of God, who has
awarded different degrees or mansions of beatitude
to all His chosen ones:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">E la sua volontade è nostra pace,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“And His will is our peace.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Transfigured now
with ineffable joy, Piccarda tells the pathetic story
of her frustrated life on earth; and points out to
Dante the Empress Constance, mother of Frederick
II., torn, like her, from the convent’s shelter.
Beatrice explains to the poet the place of all the
saints in the Empyrean—the “heaven of humility
where Mary is,” as Dante had sung long before of
Beatrice herself in the <i>Vita Nuova</i>—and the reason
of this temporary apparition in the moon
(<i>Par.</i> iv.). The other questions solved in this
sphere are all connected with Free Will. Rectitude
of will is necessary for the gaining of Paradise,
and nothing whatever can take away that
freedom of the will. “As regards the proper act
of the will, no violence can be done to the will”;
and, since Piccarda and Constance yielded through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
fear of greater evil, they fell voluntarily from the
state of perfection to which they were called.
Freedom of the will is God’s greatest gift to man
(<i>Par.</i> v. 19-24); hence the sanctity of an accepted
vow, wherein this supreme gift is offered to God
as victim, although Holy Church has power to
commute, save, apparently, in the case of solemn
vows of perpetual chastity. It will be observed
that this heaven is moved by the Angels, who are
severally assigned to individuals as guardians,
and who are the bearers of tidings of God’s
bounty to men; and, corresponding to this, the
questions solved relate to the salvation and guidance
of individual souls, and to the great gift of
liberty, whereby God’s bounty is specially shown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Heaven of Mercury.</span>—In the second
sphere, the heaven of Mercury, appear the souls
of those who did great things for humanity or for
special nations, but who were actuated by mixed
motives; personal ambition, desire of fame and
honour, made “the rays of true love mount upwards
less vividly” (<i>Par.</i> vi. 117); and they have
thus the next lowest mansion of beatitude to the
spirits that appeared in the inconstant Moon. The
Emperor Justinian recites the proud history of
the Roman Eagle, and shows how Divine Providence
established the sway of the Roman people
over all the earth, made the Eagle the instrument
of the Atonement offered by Christ for all mankind,
the avenger of His death, the protector of
His Church. As the monarch who reformed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
codified Roman Law, of which he is for Dante the
personification, and who restored Italy to the Empire
(the work which the <i>Veltro</i> is to renew under
altered conditions of Christendom), Justinian lifts
the imperial ideal far above the factious politics of
the Middle Ages, condemning Guelfs and Ghibellines
alike as traitors and sowers of discord.
Here, too, is Romeo of Villanova, who did in a lesser
degree for Provence what Justinian did for the
Empire, thus appearing with him in the sphere
that is moved by the Archangels, whose function
is to guide and protect particular nations. The
figure of Romeo—unjustly accused of corrupt
practices in office, supporting with magnanimous
heart the poverty and humiliations of voluntary
exile—is perhaps an unconscious portrait of Dante
himself. Even as the Archangels announce messages
of special import and sacredness, as Gabriel
did to Mary, so Beatrice explains to Dante the
mystery of man’s redemption by the Incarnation
and Crucifixion, the supremest work at once of
Divine Justice and Divine Mercy (<i>Par.</i> vii.), and
touches somewhat upon the immortality of the
soul and the resurrection of the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Heaven of Venus.</span>—The third heaven, the
sphere of Venus, is moved by the celestial Principalities,
whose office is to influence earthly rulers
to imitate the principality of God, by uniting love
with their lordship. They are those, according to
St. Bernard, “by whose management and wisdom
all principality on earth is set up, ruled, limited,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
transferred, diminished, and changed.” Into this
sphere descend the souls of purified lovers, brilliant
lights moving circle-wise and hidden in the
rays of their own joy. Carlo Martello, son of
Charles II. of Naples, and son-in-law of Rudolph
of Hapsburg, who, by reason of his marriage
with Clemenza, might have healed the feuds of
Guelfs and Ghibellines, pictures the realms over
which he should have ruled, denounces the misgovernment
of his own house, and explains the influence
of the celestial bodies for the constitution of
society and the government of states (<i>Par.</i> viii.).
Cunizza da Romano, the famous sister of Ezzelino,
rebukes the anarchy of the March of Treviso; a
“modern child of Venus,” she here appears as the
type of a perfect penitent (<i>Par.</i> ix.). Like her,
Folco of Marseilles, poet then prelate, but here
recorded only as troubadour, remembers the love
sins of his youth, not with sorrow, but with gratitude
to the Divine Mercy and wonder at the mysteries
of Providence. Rahab of Jericho, the highest
spirit of this sphere, is a type of the Church,
saved by Christ’s blood from the ruin of the
world; and, with a fine thrust at the loveless avarice
of the Pope and his cardinals, Dante passes
with Beatrice beyond the shadow of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Heaven of the Sun.</span>—To mark this higher
grade of bliss and knowledge, Dante pauses on his
entrance into the fourth sphere, the heaven of the
Sun, to sing again of the Creation, the work of the
Blessed Trinity, and the order of the Universe, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
visible expression of the perfection of Divine art
(<i>Par.</i> x. 1-21). The Sun is ruled by the celestial
Powers, the angelic order that represents the Divine
majesty and power, combats the powers of
darkness, and stays diseases. Here, in two garlands
of celestial lights surrounding Dante and
Beatrice, appear the glorious souls of twenty-four
teachers and doctors, who illuminated the world
by example and doctrine; the twofold work of
co-operation with the celestial Powers, which is
seen in its supereminent degree in the lives of
St. Francis and St. Dominic, the champions who
led the armies of Christ against the powers of
darkness and healed the spiritual diseases of
the Christian world. St. Thomas Aquinas, the
great light of the Dominicans, after naming the
other eleven spirits of his circle (Albertus Magnus,
Gratian, Peter Lombard, Solomon, Dionysius,
Orosius, Boëthius, Isidore, Bede, Richard of St.
Victor, and Siger), sings the glorious panegyric
of St. Francis, the seraphic bridegroom of
Poverty, laments the backsliding of the Dominicans
(<i>Par.</i> xi.). St. Bonaventura, once minister-general
of the Franciscans, extols the marvellous
life of St. Dominic, the cherubical lover of Faith,
the great paladin in Holy Church’s victorious
battle where St. Francis bore the standard of the
Crucified (<i>Par.</i> xii.). Lamenting the degenerate
state of the Franciscans, he names the eleven spirits
that accompany him; two of the followers of
St. Francis, Illuminato and Agostino; Hugh of St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
Victor; Peter Comestor, Peter of Spain (the logician
whose elevation to the papacy as John XXI.
may be ignored in Paradise), Nathan, Chrysostom,
St. Anselm, Aelius Donatus (the Latin grammarian),
Rabanus Maurus, and the Calabrian
abbot Joachim. Lovers of poverty, rebukers of corruption,
historians, mystics, theologians, writers
of humble text-books are here associated in the
same glory, as servants of truth in the same warfare
against the powers of darkness. They illustrate
what St. Bonaventura calls the broadness of
the illuminative way. Each group closes with a
spirit whose orthodoxy had been at least questioned.
Siger of Brabant, the champion of Averroism
at the university of Paris, had “syllogised
invidious truths,” and met with a violent death at
the Papal Court at Orvieto about 1284. Joachim
of Flora, “endowed with prophetic spirit,” had
foretold the advent of the epoch of the Holy Ghost,
in which the Everlasting Gospel, the spiritual interpretation
of the Gospel of Christ, would leave
no place for disciplinary institutions; his later
followers among the Franciscans had been condemned
at the Council of Anagni in 1256.</p>

<p>St. Thomas further explains to Dante the
grades of perfection in God’s creatures, from the
Angels downwards; whereby His Divine light is
more or less imperfectly reflected, and the likeness
of the Divine ideas more or less imperfectly expressed—perfectly
only when the Trinity creates
immediately, as in the case of Adam and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
humanity of Christ (<i>Par.</i> xiii.). Solomon, whose
peerless wisdom St. Thomas had explained as
“royal prudence,” instructs Dante concerning the
splendour of the body after the resurrection, when
human personality will be completed and the perfection
of beatitude fulfilled (<i>Par.</i> xiv.). In a
mysteriously beautiful apparition of what seems
to be another garland of spirits in the Sun, this
vision of the fourth heaven closes; and Beatrice
and her lover are “translated to more lofty salvation”
in the glowing red of Mars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Heaven of Mars.</span>—The fifth heaven, the
sphere of Mars, is ruled by the angelic Virtues.
This is the order which images the Divine strength
and fortitude; their name, according to Dionysius,
signifies “a certain valiant and unconquerable virility.”
According to St. Bernard, they are those
“by whose command or work signs and prodigies
are wrought among the elements, for the admonition
of mortals,” and it is through them that the
sign of the Son of Man shall appear in heaven as
foretold in the Gospel.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Therefore, in Mars, Dante
beholds a great image of the Crucified, blood-red,
formed by stars which are the souls of the warrior
saints, whom the Virtues impressed at their birth
with the influence of the planet (<i>Par.</i> xvii. 76-78),
to be strongly and manfully valiant, and to do
notable things on earth (<i>ibid.</i> 92, 93), even as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
Virtues, according to St. Bernard, work signs and
prodigies among the elements.</p>

<p>Cacciaguida passes from the right arm of the
Cross to greet his descendant, like Anchises to
Aeneas in Elysium. In his long discourse with the
poet (<i>Par.</i> xv. and xvi.) we dimly discern a splendidly
ideal picture of a free Italian commune of
the twelfth century, before what Dante regards as
the corrupting influence of wealth and illegitimate
extension of its boundaries had fallen upon it, and
before the hostility of the Church to the Empire,
with the resulting confusion of persons in the city,
had involved the Florentines in the feuds of Guelfs
and Ghibellines. Then, having bitterly lamented
the decay of the old Florentine families and the
corruption of their successors, Cacciaguida co-operates
with the Virtues by inspiring Dante with
endurance and fortitude to suffer unjust exile and
perform his life’s work (<i>Par.</i> xvii.). In the famous
and most noble lines, to which reference has
already been made in touching upon this epoch of
Dante’s life, Cacciaguida foretells the poet’s banishment,
the calumnies of his enemies, his sufferings
in exile, his forming a party to himself, the
future greatness of Can Grande, Dante’s own certainty
of eternal fame. And let him be no timid
friend to truth, but make manifest his whole
vision, and especially assail corruption in highest
places (<i>cf. Mon.</i> iii. 1). It is Dante’s apologia for
his own life, first as citizen, then as poet. The
keynote of the closing years of his life is struck at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
the opening of Canto xviii.: “And that Lady who
was leading me to God said: ‘Change thy thought;
think that I am near to Him who unburdens every
wrong.’” Gazing upon her, his affection “was
free from every other desire.” Then, with a
charge of celestial chivalry across the sky, this
vision of warriors closes; Joshua and Judas Maccabaeus,
Charlemagne and Orlando, William of
Orange still with Renoardo, Godfrey de Bouillon
and Robert Guiscard, flash through the Cross, and
are rejoined by Cacciaguida in their motion and
their song.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Heaven of Jupiter.</span>—The silvery white
sphere of Jupiter, the sixth heaven, is ruled by the
Dominations, the angelic order which images the
archetypal dominion in God as the source of true
dominion. “We must consider in the Dominations,”
writes St. Bernard, “how great is the
majesty of the Lord, at whose bidding empire is
established, and of whose empire universality and
eternity are the bounds.” This, then, is the sphere
of ideal government, the heaven of the planet
that effectuates justice upon earth (<i>Par.</i> xviii.
115-117). The souls of faithful and just rulers
appear as golden lights, singing and flying like
celestial birds. They first form the text, <i>Diligite
iustitiam que iudicatis terram</i>, “Love justice, you
that are the judges of the earth” (<i>Wisdom</i>, i. 1,
Vulgate), tracing successively the letters until
they rest in the final golden M, the initial letter of
Monarchy or Empire, under which alone can justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
be paramount on earth, and then, with further
transformations, become the celestial Eagle (<i>Par.</i>
xviii. 100-114). This is the “sign which made the
Romans reverend in the world” (xix. 101); no
emblem of material conquest, but the image of the
sempiternal justice of the Primal Will, the type of
dominion on earth ordained by God. It is the
allegorical representation of the doctrines of the
<i>Monarchia</i>. And, since justice is obscured and
good government rendered abortive by the simony
of the pastors of the Church, which leads them to
oppose the Empire, Dante has a bitter word in
season for the reigning pontiff, John XXII (<i>Par.</i>
xviii. 130-136).</p>

<p>In the perfect concord of its component spirits
the Eagle, speaking with one voice, discourses
upon the immutability and absolute justice of the
Divine Will, which is inscrutable and incomprehensible
to mortals (<i>Par.</i> xix.). Having rebuked
the wickedness of all the kings and princes then
reigning, from the Emperor-elect (Albert of Austria
in 1300) to the King of Cyprus, it sets forth
in contrast to them the example of just and righteous
monarchs and rulers of olden time, the six
noblest of whom now form its eye—David, Trajan,
Hezekiah, Constantine, the Norman William II. of
Sicily, and Rhipeus the Trojan (<i>Par.</i> xx.). Three
exquisite lines (73-75)—introduced as a mere image—render
the flight and song of the skylark
with a beauty and fidelity to nature which even
Shelley was not to surpass. The salvation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
Trajan, through the prayers of St. Gregory, and
Rhipeus, by internal inspiration concerning the
Redeemer to come, unveils yet more wondrous
mysteries in the treasury of Divine Justice, which
suffers itself to be overcome by hope and love.
Rhipeus, the justest among the Trojans and the
strictest observer of right (Virgil, <i>Aen.</i> ii. 426,
427; <i>cf.</i> Acts x. 35), by his presence solves Dante’s
doubt concerning the fate of the just heathen who
die without baptism, and indicates that the race
which gave the ancestors to the Roman people was
not without Divine light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heaven of Saturn.</span>—The last of the seven heavens
of the planets is the sphere of Saturn, over
which the Thrones preside. According to Dionysius,
the Thrones are associated with steadfastness,
supermundane tendency towards and reception
of the Divine. They represent, according to
St. Bernard, supreme tranquillity, most calm serenity,
peace which surpasses all understanding;
and upon them God sits as judge (<i>cf. Par.</i> ix. 61,
62). In Saturn appear the contemplative saints,
and the monks who kept firm and steadfast in the
cloister. They pass up and down the celestial Ladder
of Contemplation (<i>Par.</i> xxi. and xxii.), the
stairway by which the soul mystically ascends to
the consideration of the impenetrable mysteries of
God which transcend all reason. In this high
stage of progress towards the suprasensible Beatrice
does not smile, for Dante’s human intellect
could not yet sustain it, and the sweet symphonies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
of Paradise are silent. St. Peter Damian discourses
upon the impenetrable mysteries of Divine
predestination, and rebukes the vicious and luxurious
lives of the great prelate and cardinals. St.
Benedict describes the foundation of his own great
order, and laments the shameless corruption of
contemporary Benedictines. Thus in this, and,
above all, in the cry like thunder which bursts
from the contemplatives at the conclusion of Peter
Damian’s words, threatening the Divine vengeance
which is to fall upon the corrupt pastors
of the Church, the saints of the seventh sphere
unite themselves with the celestial Thrones, whose
office is purification, and who are the mirrors of
the terrible judgments of God.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Gemini.</span>—At Beatrice’s bidding, Dante follows
the contemplatives up the celestial ladder,
entering the Firmament at the sign of the Gemini
or Twins, beneath which he was born (<i>Par.</i> xxii.
112-123). To his natal stars, and thus to the
Cherubim with whose virtue they are animated, he
appeals for power to complete the work for which
they have inspired him. In a momentary vision,
with the capacity of his inward soul enlarged, he
looks down upon the whole Universe, and estimates
aright the relative value of all things in
heaven and earth, now that he is prepared to witness
the true glories of Paradise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Stellar Heaven.</span>—The Firmament or
stellar heaven, the eighth sphere, is ruled by the
Cherubim, who represent the Divine Wisdom; it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
the celestial counterpart of the Garden of Eden.
Here the fruit of man’s redemption is mystically
shown in a vision of the triumph of Christ, the
new Adam, surrounded by myriads of shining
lights which draw their light from Him and represent
the souls of the blessed whom He has sanctified
(<i>Par.</i> xxiii.). After Christ has ascended
from this celestial garden, where Mary is the rose
and the Apostles the lilies, the Archangel Gabriel
descends with ineffable melody and attends upon
the new Eve, “the living garden of delight,
wherein the condemnation was annulled and the
tree of life planted,”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> in her Assumption.</p>

<p>The four spheres of the higher planets had set
forth a celestial realisation of the four cardinal
virtues, Prudence, Fortitude, Justice, and Temperance,
with perfect man according to the capacity
of human nature; now, in this sphere of the Cherubim
whose name indicates plenitude of the knowledge
of God, Dante is examined upon the three
theological virtues, which have God for their object
as He transcends the knowledge of our reason,
and which put man on the way to supernatural
happiness. “If we would enter Paradise and
the fruition of Truth,” writes St. Bonaventura,
“the image of our mind must be clothed with the
three theological virtues, whereby the mind is purified,
illumined, and rendered perfect, and thus
the image is reformed and made fit for the Jerusalem
which is above.” Dante’s answers to St. Peter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
upon Faith (<i>Par.</i> xxiv.), to St. James upon Hope
(<i>Par.</i> xxv.), to St. John upon Charity (<i>Par.</i> xxvi.),
contain the essence of the devout wisdom of the
schoolmen upon those three divine gifts, whereby
man participates in the Deity, and “we ascend to
philosophise in that celestial Athens, where Stoics
and Peripatetics and Epicureans, by the art of the
eternal Truth, harmoniously concur in one will”
(<i>Conv.</i> iii. 14). For the object of Faith and Love
alike Dante, even in Paradise, can appeal to the
<i>Metaphysics</i> of Aristotle (<i>Par.</i> xxiv. 130-132, xxvi.
37-39); and all the celestial music cannot quite
drown the poet’s sigh for that fair Florentine
sheepfold, from which he is still barred out, though
Hell and Heaven have opened for him their eternal
gates (<i>Par.</i> xxv. 1-12). Within a fourth light the
soul of Adam appears, to instruct Dante upon the
proper cause of his fall and upon his life in the
Earthly Paradise, now that the poet has seen the
triumph and ascent of the new Adam. Adam, in
whom was directly infused all the light lawful to
human nature to have (<i>Par.</i> xiii. 43), is the last
soul that appears to Dante until the consummation
of the vision in the Empyrean. On the close of his
discourse, a hymn of glory to the Blessed Trinity
resounds through Paradise, a laugh of the Universe
in joy of the mystery of Redemption (<i>Par.</i>
xxvii. 1-9). Then, while all Heaven blushes and
there is a celestial eclipse as at the Crucifixion,
St. Peter utters a terrible denunciation of the
scandals and corruption in the Papacy and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
Church, wherein Dante, as in the Epistle to the
Italian Cardinals, takes his stand as the Jeremiah
of Roman Catholicity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ninth Heaven.</span>—When the saints have returned
to their places in the Empyrean, Dante,
after a last look to earth, passes up with his lady
into the ninth sphere, the Crystalline heaven.
Beatrice discourses upon the order of the heavens
and the want of government upon earth, prophesying
that, before very long, deliverance and reformation
will come, even as St. Peter had announced
in the sphere below. Here, where nature begins,
Dante has a preparatory manifestation of the nine
angelic orders, the ministers of Divine Providence,
who ordain and dispose all things by moving the
spheres. They appear as nine circles of flame,
revolving round an atomic Point of surpassing
brilliancy, which symbolises the supreme unity of
God, the poet again having recourse to the <i>Metaphysics</i>
of Aristotle: “From that Point depends
heaven and all nature” (<i>Par.</i> xxviii. 41, 42). Each
angelic circle is swifter and more brilliant as it is
nearer to the centre, each hierarchy striving after
the utmost possible assimilation to God and union
with Him. Swiftest and brightest of all are the
Seraphim, who move this ninth sphere; the angelic
order that, representing the Divine Love, loves
most and knows most. “In the Angels,” says
Colet on Dionysius, “an intensity of knowledge is
love; a less intense love is knowledge.” The relation
of the Seraphim to the Cherubim is that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
fire to light; their special office is perfecting, as
that of the Cherubim is illumination. All the
orders contemplate God, and manifest Him to
creatures to draw them to Him. Receiving from
God the Divine light and love that makes them
like to Him, the higher orders reflect this to the
lower, like mirrors reflecting the Divine rays; and
these lower orders reflect it to men, so rendering
all things, as far as possible to each nature, like
to God and in union with Him. After distinguishing
between the different orders according to Dionysius,
Beatrice speaks of their creation as especially
illustrating the Divine Love, which the Seraphim
represent (<i>Par.</i> xxix.), and their place in the
order of the Universe, the fall of the rebellious,
the reward of the faithful, and their immeasurable
number. Each Angel belongs to a different species,
and each differs from every other in its
reception of Divine light and love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Empyrean.</span>—Dante and Beatrice now issue
forth of the last material sphere into the Empyrean,
the true Paradise of vision, comprehension,
and fruition, where man’s will is set at rest in
union with universal Good, and his intellect in the
possession of universal Truth. In preparation for
this Divine union, Dante is momentarily blinded
by the Divine light which overpowers him with its
radiance—a blindness followed by a new celestial
sight and new faculties for comprehending the
essence of spiritual things. The first empyreal
vision is still a foreshadowing preface: a river of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
light, the stream which makes the city of God
joyful, the wondrous flowers of celestial spring,
the living sparks of angelic fire. This river of
Divine grace is the fountain of wisdom from
which, according to Bernard, the Cherubim drink,
to pour out the streams of knowledge upon all
God’s citizens; and of this fountain Dante, too,
drinks with his eyes, that he may more fully see
the vision of God which he has to relate, to diffuse
His knowledge upon earth as the Cherubim do
from Heaven. By the light of glory his mind is
rendered capable of seeing those spiritual things
which the blessed behold with immediate intuition,
and of ultimate union with the Divine Essence
(<i>Par.</i> xxx. 100-102). The river seems to change
to a circular ocean of light; the saints and Angels
appear in their true forms, all united in the sempiternal
Rose of Paradise. Even at this height
of ecstatic alienation from terrestrial things,
Dante can turn in thought to Pope and Emperor
who should be leading men to beatitude; a throne
is prepared for Henry in this convent of white
stoles, while the hell of the simoniacs is gaping
for Boniface and Clement.</p>

<p>Eternity, as defined by Boëthius, is “the complete
and perfect simultaneous possession of unlimited
life”; and Dante is one who has come from
time to the eternal: <i>a l’etterno dal tempo era
venuto</i> (<i>Par.</i> xxxi. 38).<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Beatrice has returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
to her throne, her allegorical mission ended; and
for this supreme revelation of the Divine beauty
in the mystical Rose, where there is no medium
to impede the poet’s sight of the Divine light (for
his is now that of a separated spirit), but blessed
souls and flying Angels are absorbed in love and
vision, St. Bernard completes her work, even as
that of Virgil had been completed by Matelda in
the Earthly Paradise. St. Bernard may represent
the glorified contemplative life in our heavenly
country, as Matelda may symbolise the glorified
active life in the state of restored Eden; or, perhaps
better, if Matelda is taken as the love rightly
ordered to which the <i>Purgatorio</i> leads, Bernard
represents the loving contemplation or contemplative
love, attained by the mystic in brief moments
here and now, in which the eternal and unchanging
life of the soul in the hereafter consists.
In an exquisite lyrical inter-breathing Dante addresses
Beatrice for the last time, thanking her
for having led him from servitude to liberty, praying
to her for final perseverance (<i>Par.</i> xxxi. 79-90).
Under the guidance of Bernard, he prepares
himself for the vision of the Divine Essence, by
disciplining his spiritual sight in contemplation
of the glory of the saints and of the ineffable
beauty of Mary, surrounded by her Angels, and
clothed, as Bernard himself puts it elsewhere, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
the Sun by whose fire the prophet’s lips were
cleansed and the Cherubim kindled with love.</p>

<p>Throughout the Rose two descending lines divide
the redeemed of the old law from the redeemed
under the new. The one line passes down
from Mary’s throne, composed of holy women,
ancestresses of Christ or types of His Church:
Eve, Rachel, Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, Ruth (<i>Par.</i>
xxxii.). With Rachel, in the third row, Beatrice
is seated. The opposite line passes down from
the seat of the Baptist, Christ’s precursor; and
begins with St. Francis, His closest and most perfect
imitator, St. Benedict (in the third row
opposite to Rachel and Beatrice), St. Augustine.
The lower sections of each half of the Rose are
occupied by the little children who died before
attaining use of reason; and who yet have different
degrees of bliss, according to the inscrutable
mysteries of predestination and Divine Justice,
which willed to give grace differently to each. Another
vision of Mary, the supreme of created
things, “the face that is most like to Christ, whose
beauty alone can dispose thee to see Christ” (<i>Par.</i>
xxxii. 85-87), is the prelude to the vision of the
Deity. Before her hovers her chosen knight, Gabriel,
the “strength of God,” the pattern of celestial
chivalry, <i>leggiadria</i>. Round her are Adam
and St. Peter, Moses and St. John the Divine;
opposite the two latter are St. Anne and St. Lucy.
Thus the three Ladies who took pity upon Dante
in the dark wood, when the mystical journey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
opened, have been seen in their glory at its
close.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary and the Divine Essence.</span>—And the poet
turns finally to the Primal Love, by Mary’s grace
and Bernard’s intercession, in the lyrical prayer
that opens the wonderful closing canto of the
<i>Commedia</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Vergine madre, figlia del tuo figlio,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p0">“Virgin Mother, daughter of thy Son.” Setting
forth her predestination from eternity to bring
the Redeemer into the world, her office of love
and hope to Heaven and earth, her infinite excellence
and dignity, her power and never-failing
love, St. Bernard implores of her grace for Dante
to rise to the vision of the Divine Essence now,
in ecstatic contemplation, and then for his final
perseverance that, on his return to earth, her loving
protection may strengthen him against the
assaults of passion, until he rejoice once more in
the Beatific Vision for all eternity. Human love
becomes one with the divine where Beatrice—joined
with him now in the union of fruition—is
named for the last time in the poem as he draws
near to his mystical goal.</p>

<p>In answer to Mary’s intercession, an anticipation
is granted to Dante of the vision wherein the
last and perfect beatitude of man consists. The
supreme experience of the soul, recognised by the
great mystics from Plotinus and Augustine to
Richard of St. Victor and Bonaventura, is rendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
into unsurpassable poetry with the impassioned
conviction that it has been the writer’s own.
All ardour of desire dies away. Entering into
the Divine light, uniting his intellectual gaze with
the Divine Essence, he actualises all potentialities
of spiritual vision therein. In the Divine light, he
beholds all nature, all Being scattered in leaves
throughout the Universe here united by love into
one volume; the vision of the First Cause which
satisfies the understanding becomes that of the
Supreme Goodness which fulfils the will; and this
First Cause, this Supreme Goodness, itself remaining
unchanged, becomes revealed to the
poet’s ever strengthening intuition as the mystery
of the Blessed Trinity, in which the Person of the
Word took Human Nature.</p>

love that moves the sun and the other stars”:</p>

<h3>D. <span class="smcap">The Minor Works</span></h3>

<p>The <i>Convivio</i> or <i>Convito</i> was first printed at Florence
in 1490. Eighteen <i>canzoni</i> (erroneously numbered as
fourteen) were published at the end of a Venetian edition
of the <i>Commedia</i> in November, 1491. Fifteen genuine
Dantesque <i>canzoni</i>, with others wrongly ascribed
to him, are contained in a collection printed at Milan and
at Venice in 1518. The first partially complete edition
of Dante’s lyrical poetry is contained in the first four
books of <i>Sonetti e canzoni di diversi antichi autori toscani
in dieci libri raccolte</i>, edited by Bernardo di Giunta
at Florence in 1527. The <i>Vita Nuova</i> was first printed
at Florence in 1576; but its lyrics had been given in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
first book of the 1527 <i>Sonetti e canzoni</i>. The <i>De Vulgari
Eloquentia</i> was published in Trissino’s Italian translation
at Vicenza in 1529, and in the original Latin at
Paris in 1577; the <i>Monarchia</i> in 1559 at Basle. The
latter work had been translated into Italian by Marsilio
Ficino in the latter half of the fifteenth century. The
Letter to Henry VII. was first published in an old Italian
version in 1547; in its original Latin by Witte in 1827.</p>

<p>The Epistle to Can Grande was first published in
1700, the Eclogues in 1719. The Letters as a whole
were edited by Witte in 1827 and by Torri in 1842.</p>

printed in 1472, at Foligno, Mantua, and Jesi. They
were reprinted, together with the Neapolitan edition of
1477, by Lord Vernon and Panizzi: <i>Le Prime Quattro
Edizioni della Divina Commedia letteralmente ristampate</i>
(London, 1858). The first Venetian edition is dated
1477, the first Florentine 1481. There were about fifteen
editions of the <i>Divina Commedia</i> published before the
end of the fifteenth century. The first Aldine was
printed in 1502. The two earliest dated manuscripts,
the Landiano (1336) and the Trivulziano (1337), have
been published in facsimile: <i>Il Codice Trivulziano 1080
della D.C.</i>, with introduction by L. Rocca (Milan, 1921);
<i>Il Codice Landiano</i> with preface by A. Balsamo and introduction
by G. Bertoni (Florence, 1921).]</p>

Parodi, <i>Poesia e storia nella D.C.</i>; Ercole, <i>Le tre fasi del
pensiero politico di Dante</i>, in the <i>Miscellanea dantesca</i>

works already cited, published for the sexcentenary of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
1921, may be particularly mentioned the sumptuous volume
<i>Dante e Siena</i> (Siena, 1921), and <i>Dante, la Vita,
le Opere, le grandi città dantesche, Dante e l’Europa</i>
(Milan, 1921).</p>

<p>The <i>Giornale Dantesco</i>, the <i>Bullettino della Società
Dantesca Italiana</i>, and <i>Studi danteschi diretti da</i> Michele
Barbi (Florence) are invaluable periodical publications.</p>

<p>Of the numerous English translations of the <i>Divina
Commedia</i>, besides those of Cary and Longfellow, may
be mentioned that of C. E. Norton in prose; Haselfoot
and M. B. Anderson in <i>terza rima</i>; G. Musgrave of the
<i>Inferno</i> in Spenserian stanzas, and H. J. Hooper in
amphiambics; C. L. Shadwell of the <i>Purgatorio</i> and
<i>Paradiso</i> in the metre used by Andrew Marvell in his
Horatian “Ode to Cromwell.” The <i>terza rima</i> is a measure
not easily adapted to English speech. First introduced
into English by Chaucer, with the modifications
which the difference of our prosody from the Italian
requires, in two fragments of <i>A Compleint to his Lady</i>
(Minor Poems vi. in Skeat’s <i>Student’s Chaucer</i>), it was
used by Wyatt and Surrey, by Sir Philip Sidney and
other Elizabethans, and even once by Milton (in his
paraphrase of Psalm ii.). Among the few notable English
poems in <i>terza rima</i> written during the nineteenth
century, Shelley’s unfinished <i>Triumph of Life</i> stands
supreme, and in it we may in very truth:</p>

<p>To indicate changes of hour, the reader may imagine the rim of the
clock to revolve <i>counterclockwise</i>, while the five hands remain
stationary, or the hands to revolve <i>clockwise</i>, while the rim remains
stationary.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, <i>Purg.</i> xxvii. 1-5, the sun was rising at Jerusalem,
‘there where his Maker shed His blood,’ when it was midnight in
Spain (on the Ebro) and noon in India, ‘the waves in Ganges
burnt by noon’; and therefore sunset in Purgatory: ‘wherefore
the day was departing, when the Angel of God joyfully appeared
to us.’</p>
